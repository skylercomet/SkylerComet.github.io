Dear Reader,

The 8 writings below are tales of adulthood, and as such deal with some mild topics.

These include discussion of abandonment, familial rejection, mental illness, anxiety, and minor mention of gendered discrimination and abuse.

I understand if you aren’t in a comfortable place to interface with these topics, and you may avoid or return to this at anytime. Please take care of yourself.

This collection contains my lived events and memories, but I am aware my eyes are only one of the pairs involved in them. For this reason, the names of places and people involved will be avoided.

This collection is addressed and dedicated to my loving partner, who I choose not to name here. Even if that isn’t you, I hope you find something in these pages nonetheless.
