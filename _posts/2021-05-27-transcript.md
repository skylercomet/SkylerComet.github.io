Hi. Surprised to see me?

It’s our first time meeting here. Face to face, that is. We’ve been talking, even if you don’t always realize that we are. It’s a strange relationship, I suppose.

I don’t really know what to say. I just thought it would be a good time to talk with you person to person. It’s been a while now. Just over a year ago if you want to put a timestamp on it, but you could trace me back to ever since you were born. You might not know everything about me, but I’ve been here watching your life play out.

I’m sorry, I just...I’m really nervous. I mean...I already don’t get out much. Now I’m meeting you for the first time, someone who I haven’t gotten to talk to directly but have been in contact with for years. I was getting butterflies in my stomach just thinking about when this would happen and it turns out...it was tonight.

I apologize for the rain, too. I don’t know why it’s so heavy, but…I suppose it’ll keep coming down hard. I know you don’t really like rain, but I have fond memories of it. I’ve only ever really seen it a couple times whenever I’ve gone out. 

I don’t know when we’ll get a moment like this again, but...hey, wait why are you crying?

…

Don’t worry, I’ll get a new jacket. This one’s yours, after all.

I understand how you feel. I guess it's strange to find ourselves separated after everything. I suppose it’s a little bittersweet.

I know what it’s like. I used to follow my father everywhere he went. I wanted to eat with him, talk with him, play with him. Everyday I just wanted to be with him more and more. I never realized it when I was young, how that dependence kept me grounded when all my life I should have been flying. It was a time I never thought to look inside myself because I was always looking out.

After he...well...when he left, I didn’t have anything anymore. I spent so many years poured into one thing that when it was gone, I didn’t know how to start again. And...well, if I could give you advice, it would be to just...keep moving forward. I know it sounds hollow, but if you take things day by day you’ll start to figure out where to go. Whenever a door closes, a new one will open somewhere. You’ll just have to find it.

...As time goes on, I’m sure we’ll both figure out what we’re meant to be. But that’s not what I’m worried about. Right now, I want to bring you somewhere. Trust me, you’ll like it.
