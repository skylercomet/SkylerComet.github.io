# About Me! #

Hi! My name is Skyler Comet (she/they), and I'm a silly lil' girl here to have a good time! I've been fascinated with creative writing ever since I was young, and I have continued to work on my writings and work for years since. I've taken the small steps to bring that hobby into the limelight for the past few years, and continued to write for patreon and other places as I develop my style.

I began streaming on Twitch despite my anxiety, and created a heartwarming community that I love and continue to enjoy my time with. I used to be a VTuber, writing a series of stories on my character Celeste before revealing my face and moving to my own self to create streams and videos of my times playing games and cracking jokes with friends!.

# Where can you find me? #

Here's Twitter, a place I kinda update things but less so now. I think it's better to find me on Discord, but this is a place to start!

Here is Twitch, where I stream playing games every so often! During my university quarters it can be hard to find me here, but during summer and my breaks you'll find me streaming quite irregularly! Make sure to check it every once and a while!

Here's my Patreon, where I'll post stories and blog posts especially for the patrons as well as behind the scenes art or videos!

I also have a youtube channel! One for my old VODs and one for edited videos and other work, but that one gets updated only once a month ;v;
