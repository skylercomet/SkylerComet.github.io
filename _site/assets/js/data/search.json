    "content": "With Patch 8 coming tomorrow to “Baldur’s Gate 3,” I want to highlight how phenomenal of a game it is. This amazing game is, however, not a TTRPG and not for lack of trying.Larian Studios and their Game of the Year entry “Baldur’s Gate 3” is a stunning RPG that uses the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world and rules to create a massive and dynamic story. It was the kind of game that took a bit of convincing, but after a good chunk of time with some friends and running through the story we immediately got hooked and explored every facet to the world we could think of. There’s some reservations from traditional video game players considering the combat style is a lot slower after being adapted from the source’s Tabletop RPG, but a lot of computerized smoothing allows turns to go a bit faster than they would normally around the table. With a new patch on the way adding more depth and even more subclasses to the game, it’s a great time to jump right in and explore the world as a new or returning player.This article, however, isn’t about that.I wanted to open with a lot of praise for the game because, as you can tell, I love it! I’ve sunk 150 hours into it with a couple playthroughs with various people, including one on their coveted “Honour” mode in which a party wipe ends with a game over. I’ve even already reserved space on my SSD to download the newest update and jump right in with my friends yet again. The issue is that this excitement from the game has been finally curbed by a new craving for TTRPGs and the enjoyment of a physical role-playing game with my friends.I’m sure people are at least somewhat familiar with Baldur’s Gate 3’s source material, but Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a sort of board game usually played with one player acting as a Dungeon Master, or DM, that runs the game’s background and story as the controlling force. The players play and act as their characters, and the DM runs everything else and leads them through the story that is played out. It’s imaginative and nerdy, but my first comprehensive experience with the TTRPG genre has finally explained to me why it is that I couldn’t find my fill within Baldur’s Gate 3. The style and world and combat might be there, but nothing can replace the naturally human aspect of a physical TTRPG.For that, I’ve turned to Pathfinder 2e—a fork of D&amp;D that is detached from Wizards of the Coast and has a separate appeal of a world with a similar style. About 2 months ago, I entered a campaign with 4 friends and a great DM at the helm as we entered into a story that I’ll be continuing today directly after this article is posted. It’s a distinctly slower process than a game of Baldur’s Gate 3 considering the time we take between sessions to make sure everyone is around and ready to play as well as the planning that goes into it beforehand, but the result is something that became a weekly joy for me. I think that despite the accessibility of Balder’s Gate 3, the lack of humanity in some of the elements is jarring compared to the incredible experience of playing a physical TTRPG.For example, while Baldur’s Gate 3 has choices that matter and ways to expand your character and their journey, it always ends up trapped within the rules of a computer system that will always come to restrict you in one way or another. I think a lot of us have various headcanons about our own characters that we enjoy enacting in the game still—for example, I enjoyed running a pyromaniac dragonborn sorcerer who’d use their fire to attempt to bust through doors and tear down structures even if the game wouldn’t really allow it. This, however, was sort of the extent of what I was doing. It was a restricted form of storytelling due to the way I couldn’t really bring my own notes to the table and work with the game to allow me some unique homebrew details. It’s this feeling that I think manifested into a fun character I played for my current campaign in Pathfinder, something I’ll go into for a while now if my friends from the campaign PROMISE NOT TO READ PAST THIS POINT.Good? Good.My wonderful girl (pictured above, art by Nicky!!) is a Psychic Kitsune by the name of Eccentricity Stillglade, or Echo for short. She’s a bubbly, naive maid with the world barely starting to open up to her as she leaves the manor for the first time after a mysterious loss of memory and melodic note addressed to her. She fights with a knife by her side and a slew of telekinetic tricks, but mostly works to heal and serve her accompanying party as she dedicates herself to protection. As a Kitsune, she also suffers from a need to feed off of emotion and memory in a homebrewed condition that I’ve written far too much on and worked with my DM to finalize. She suffers from many other minor details in a long backstory that leaves her with other minor quirks, such as the voice in her head she hears from beyond the planes of reality that directed her to the starting location of the campaign. As she struggles with the dangers of a world that will trample her and her childlike innocence without a care, she has to find a way to grow up and be the dependable assistant her party needs before they’re swallowed whole by the war that storms the lands.And all of this is just the surface of this story. Echo’s tale is open-ended and grows with each session as my DM runs us through a world that she has to react to. While I had issues learning to involve myself in shared storytelling and give up an element of control with my original character, I fell in love with the result as she begins to expand and grow into someone I feel is one of my most satisfying fictional characters. It was this element of Pathfinder that made me realize how different it was from Balder’s Gate 3—working with my fellow party members and DM to create something truly unique to me that everyone was excited to see, a feeling shared by my excitement to see all the things my friends had created as well. The creativity of my friends is something I enjoy celebrating, whether outside of sessions when talking about obscure lore or during the sessions as they explain how they attempt to reason with enemy scouts. There’s also an element of creating tension through relationships and how our characters clash and talk, making decisions that others disagree with and going through complex intrapersonal discussions on how we can get along.An additional note I would love to address alongside it—the scuff of human error also improves the experience of playing the game compared to a computer. Things are set in stone in ways that, while still inspiring creativity with unique ways to solve issues in Baldur’s Gate 3, must still work alongside what the computer expects. There’s no debate or discussion, but just a matter of fact reality that disconnects me from the whimsical nature. The removal of this comes with the cost of corner cases and rolling back rules or scenes to fix issues, but the nature of it comes off as comedic brevity that always manages to feel natural despite the tense nature of situations. I’m reminded of a fun conversation between a fellow player and his DM, interrupting the DM’s description of an arrow dissolving into a mud elemental’s body with a note of its damage being reduced because of the nature of the piercing arrow being slowed on impact. It was then that my player had to remind the DM of the bow’s magical power in which it deals bludgeoning damage for the purpose of resistances. The DM spoke up after a short consideration.“Fuck I’m lying then.”The amount of laughter during sessions even during emotional beats never fails to leave me with a smile, but even those moments cannot stop the weight of some of the struggles during sessions from hitting particularly hard. The storytelling and worldbuilding with a select group of friends feels incredible when the limit is non-existent, instead just a suggestion as we homebrew and create our story together in a way unlike any game a computer could ever hold. What a TTRPG is fundamentally transcends video games by bending rules in a way that allows for a world that remains defined but adjustable.I’ll wrap up by reiterating—I love Baldur’s Gate 3, and highly recommend it to people to enjoy. I’ll be playing tomorrow for sure to enjoy the new things added with Patch 8. But, additionally, I recommend to anyone that has the opportunity to try and run a TTRPG of whatever system appeals so you can enjoy the feeling of what Baldur’s Gate 3 was attempting to replicate. I’m sure some people may enjoy it more than the physical experience of TTRPGs like Pathfinder due to various reasons or faster play, but the two are separate experiences that are not interchangeable and both are worthy of your time and attention.Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll have to step into the big shoes of my darling Eccentricity in a moment and take on the invaders to protect the spirits of our magical lands."

    "content": "With the general pessimism surrounding “Marathon” as Bungie’s new IP, I think it’s important to remind people why we should keep open minds and try out games. That’s why I played Hole.With us one day after the Marathon announcement from Bungie about their new PvPvE extraction shooter, we’re officially going into the insufferable social media period in which it seems that the only opinion you can find between fanart of characters is the doomed complaining that surrounds every new release. While the experience is likely better for those of us on Bluesky where a kinder audience is curated, it still is awash with some confusing details. And that also means, for those of you on twitter, that things are astronomically worse with a select group of people focused on the Gamergate-like opinions of the right wing grifters currently trying to propel their “go woke, go broke” mentality.It’s an absolutely infuriating period of time for anyone who’s excited for what’s coming—rather than being able to share in the joy of a cool announcement, people are instead focused on the best ways to make their view known that they’re not supportive of the game. In a way, this negativity is important in some circumstances—with games like “The Day Before” and “Cyberpunk 2077” launching to incredibly harsh criticism over fairly glaring issues, being able to raise alarms of potential problems not only to other buyers but devs as well can be useful. The problem here is that, as is usual, people take simple preconceived ideas of things such as genre or development process and spin them into narratives of failure that do nothing but bring the mood down. With my discussion of engine worries before a game releases in my Titanfall 3 article and the recent example of discussing the ways Marathon is explicitly subverting expectations in my last article, it’s important to recognize the harm in some of this.(The latter is, of course, also up for discussion. I’ve had some feedback discussions and tinkered that article to better explain how different Marathon is shaping up to be compared to other games in the genre.)It’s here that I get to the main argument I want to put forth—I’m a very positive person and avoid spreading negativity about games regardless of my experience with them. As I’ve discussed frequently, I try to quell that side of me in order to leave room for people to enjoy the things they do. It’s this reason that I want to inspire similarly open-minded perspectives in approach to games that haven’t yet released and may surpass expectations, including but not limited to Marathon. I didn’t really understand how to explain this point, however. I was planning a systematic sentiment analysis of posts made about the game a day after the reveal, but even that felt like I would only succeed in defending a single multi-billion dollar corporation rather than helping instill the mindset I want to convey.It was then that I found Hole.I’ve teased it quite a bit, but I’ll drop the ominous and vaguely suggestive jokes I’ve been making to explain it: Hole is a PvE fps developed by Japanese indie dev Negafish, released in late 2024. I discovered it because as I researched for yesterday’s article, it appeared as one of the only games with “Overwhelmingly Positive” reviews under the “Extraction Shooter” tag. For a $5 price tag, I gave it a try right after my article just to see how it felt. I think this mentality comes somewhat from my time in streaming—as a small creator, it always feels like you want to have people stumble across the content and give it an honest shot despite the low view count. As such, I attempt this courtesy for others in fields I enjoy—videos, streams, games, and shows that I happen across and decide to give a bit of time to see if I get hooked.The resulting experience this time was incredible. Hole is an awesome tactical shooter, bringing a nice set of rules to gunplay that feel intuitive but nuanced in a way that demands at least a bit of your attention. It’s stylized in a way that makes the low-poly graphics never intrusive on the visual clarity, and the challenge of the game is pretty unique for a shooter. As a single-player extraction, there’s a sort of confidence I can gain for every enemy in a space but the variability and corner cases keep me always on edge as runs get longer. It’s a fantastic game that instantly took my attention away from writing to sink almost 5 hours into it just today before I got to making this article. Is it perfect? No, of course not. Some aspects feel sparse and I can imagine some of the replayability getting tedious. It also, as an extraction shooter, suffers from some of the slow exploratory phases and the time it takes to get back into the action after a failed run. But was it well worth a couple dollars and a Sunday morning? Absolutely.I think giving certain types of games a try within a massive industry is one of the best things you can do for yourself if you’re feeling sick of the current new releases. Having a diverse library of games under your belt helps you appreciate the ones you like more, as well as helping build up the market in supporting the much smaller indie developers and inspire unique mechanics rather than updated graphics. While I am specifically noting indie developers, the same can be applied similarly to Marathon. While Bungie will be ok at the end of the day with their existing IPs and Sony’s support, giving them a chance to put their resources into something that differs from existing market products is a small step in making a more diverse industry. Even if you’re not worried about the economic impact of your purchases and what it signals to corporations, it’s still a good way to find something new you might like. Games like Marathon offer small spins on existing ones that can appeal to different audiences, something I’m sure we’re all familiar with. If you were having to debate the differences between “Minecraft” and “Terraria” or “Call of Duty” and “Halo” in grade school, I’m sure we’re on the same page with how a genre isn’t the end of someone’s tastes. Inspiring creation and bold strokes in media is how we end up pushing the limits and discovering whole new ways to make classics that will stick in the hearts of fans.So take your hands off the keyboard for a while and close social media—nobody out there can tell you how to feel. Instead, check it out or give it a try when it comes out."

    "content": "With Bungie giving us more details on “Marathon” to think of with a September release date, I’m really excited to see an extraction shooter that’s starting to play more with the genre in ways that finally have me excited for the results.Today was Bungie’s latest stream to finally drop off some gameplay footage of their new shooter—the PvPvE Extraction Shooter named “Marathon” that was announced back in 2023. The game is surrounded by skepticism—at least from my view in the Destiny community, a lot of players accusing Bungie’s split attention between IPs as stealing funding and focus from their first live service game. Since the announcement in 2023, so little information has been available on Marathon that all the followers of Bungie and their work have been waiting with bated breath as the months continued to pass. Today’s stream not only gave us the details of the new game, but left us with the September 23rd release date as well as a coming closed playtest later this month. So, what’s the verdict?Personally, I’m stoked.I’ve gotten my fair share of battle royales and extraction shooters under my belt—even without the popular “Escape from Tarkov”, I have quite a bit of time spent in “Hunt: Showdown” as well as some of the other comparable games such as “Apex: Legends” and “Helldivers 2.” Despite it all, the entry of Marathon seems to shake things up with uniquely different design choices that, in all honesty, have me pretty excited for the release. I had a pretty solid skepticism over the game as a Destiny 2 fan who would have loved more production on Bungie’s star pupil, but an open mind left me really hoping that their game will succeed and live to grow into something beautiful. Even as we get more entries into the extraction shooter genre, I think Bungie has used their expertise to create an explicitly different style of game that solves a lot of issues that I personally have with these types of games.The first of which appeared in conversation of Contracts, a new system for Marathon that involves objectives to complete within the maps. These objectives are linked to their Factions, a form of cross-match progression for the players and their armory. The objectives are seen as major goals for runs, developers on the livestream talking about their runs starting as simple quests that they then use to find high level gear or get into extended battles. The world of Marathon and each player in it are going to be working with their team to do different goals, some of which I anticipate are almost peaceful and may end up with players simply going their separate ways. Others, I assume, will be categorized by bloodbaths of all 18 players duking it out over a limited resource. I think this is one of the ways that the larger scale PvP shooters have been helping newer players still feel like they’re accomplishing progress. “Fortnite” is a great example of this, adding lots of quests and side objectives around their map to give you other reasons to play the game rather than being the last one standing. The contracts will probably change the way players interact with matches and will not only improve the replayability of the game but allow for players who are more engaged with the PvP or PvE sides of the game to focus more on what they enjoy playing. While fans of (technically) extraction shooter Helldivers 2 may find some love for the PvE of the game, others from exclusively PvP battle royales might also enjoy the other side. Marathon will likely not allow players to avoid one side or the other, but the focus can maybe entice players of strictly PvE or PvP bias to spread their wings a bit.This also brings in the Factions, which are rewarding players for completing Contracts and supplying them with gear. A detail discussed in their Gameplay Overview Trailer lets us know that the Factions will provide us with “sponsors” that involve a “fresh loadout, so you can get right back into the fight.” This mechanic seems to imply a higher level of base starting equipment than the traditional extraction shooter or battle royale, allowing for faster gameplay by streamlining some of the early looting and allowing players to take on fights quicker. With the ways that Hunt: Showdown and other shooters can make major distinctions between their higher level and lower level gearing, Marathon is looking to keep it intact while also never leaving people without the option to go in with a reasonable kit for fighting. While other games might have you scrambling for a second best after your primary loadout gets lost in the field after an unfortunate fight, Bungie wants to keep your runs going fast and strong without taking away the power of higher level loot. This is a major upgrade from my time with Hunt: Showdown after a good 30 hours of building characters. One unlucky run with a smart enemy or an unfortunate misplay can take away a long time Hunter that feels agonizing to build back up, especially as someone with less mastery of the game.Finally is the titular Bungie gunplay, a staple of their games since Halo 3 and their defining trait when it comes to satisfying first person shooters. They’re fast and action-packed, combining satisfying movement with easy to use and fun to master guns that are the pinnacle of the genre to many gamers. Marathon is fast, but devs mention that they want to implant costs to movement in order to allow the pacing of the game to match that of a large scale shooter without losing their characteristic flow. Their guns are also shown as smooth within the Creator Alpha Gameplay Highlights, watching creators like Skarrow9 and Dr. Lupo fire off rounds in weapons that feel familiar to Bungie while also appearing unique to the world of Marathon. I have no doubt that gamers will feel right at home with these guns, enjoying their feeling and taking down NPCs and players alike with satisfying clicks. In addition, they made smaller choices such as the ability to resurrect teammates even after they’ve been brutally stabbed in a finisher so that you’re never out until your last teammate falls. A lot of these choices feel specificly aimed at addressing some of the main complaints I’ve heard about critics of the extraction shooter genre, namely the Escape from Tarkov and Hunt: Showdown pace of games being incredibly slow and stealthy. With tactical play at the front and well placed shots from cover being enough to fell an experienced player, the name of the game is survival above all else. This creates careful and paranoid gameplay that doesn’t have the same adventerous feeling as a lot of gamers want from their shooters. With crisp gunplay and movement at the front of the action, Bungie seems to be aiming for a distinct pacing that will separate itself from other entries in the genre.All of these new details work to propel Marathon away from traditional battle royales and extraction shooters to instead fulfill a new fantasy for gamers—a shooter with fast paced action and danger that can never stop them, but only leaves them with fuel for the next run. While I’ve had many of my days playing battle royales end with 30-40 minute walks that were ruined by single shots and leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, it feels that Marathon wants to provide experiences with less penalty for death while still maintaining the tense nature and joy of victory. Contracts were specified to allow for progress to be accomplished regardless of deaths, meaning players can safely lose gunfights while still having progressed Faction ranks and carry that experience forwards. With the “sponsors” from Factions to give us a level of gear, players can bounce back faster from losing a match and run in with determination to bring home another killer piece of loot without a slow startup. The fast-paced gunplay and action also means that less of the games will revolve around slower roaming phases of looting zones, instead allowing for run and gun shooting that keeps people engaged every step of the way. Bungie is working to make an extraction shooter that keeps the adrenaline going while giving players the opportunity to fail without it putting them so far behind that they’d give up and give it a try the next day. It’s a unique experience that, despite my hesitations to step into the genre right now, makes me excited for the future. As I punch my ticket in to see if I can snag a spot in their closed beta over on their Discord, I’m really optimistic towards the future of Marathon.So, hope I see some of you as fellow Runners on September 23rd, where escape will make us gods."

    "content": "I wanted something chill for my birthday, so I decided to write something about birthdays that I’m both constantly reminded of and also reminded of too little.I know that people have very different ways of expressing their birthdays—some friends enjoy every day with a countdown to their special day, and others often shrug it off and avoid it. I’m somewhere close to the latter—I often keep my birthday close to my chest, enough that it took my girlfriend a moment to remember without a note in her calendar. I’m sure a couple of my friends will learn that today is my birthday solely through the fact that I’m writing this article today.Which, of course, will be pretty short. I’d like some time to relax and rest.It’s just something I wanted to mention as I existed on my birthday—as I grew up slowly, the whimsy around my birthday faded away as I ran out of time and dedication to enjoy it. I’m sure we all remember days of birthday parties and bringing cookies to the class, but things slowly got less and less easy to accomplish. Part of this is my apathy towards the day but a lot more is just due to the fact of growing up. It was just something I wanted to highlight and, as a writer focused on gaming, discuss in relation to games and their joy.It was the nature of joy and whimsy that comes from birthdays that I wanted to understand should exist within games. It isn’t uncommon for games to ask for your birthday—at least with live-service games or ones that require alternative accounts. Even so, I find that only free-to-play gacha games I touch infrequently will reward my birthday with a couple of easily gathered resources with a pretty standard message. It feels like a product of our time with the early internet, constant safety around our days of birth in order to avoid a dangerous site using it for malice. While this danger is somewhat real, the level of comfort we’ve gotten with sharing our birthdays online in social media means that if someone wanted to get our birthday, they would most likely find it through a couple of searches.It’s the whimsy that I care about—I’m simply brought back to a time of joy I remember of a very old birthday in which I received a call from Geoffrey the Giraffe telling me about how it was my birthday. Geoffrey—the mascot for Toys “R” Us—was a pre-recorded message and these calls were sent to people who signed up for a “Birthday Club” that gave your kid a message on their special day. No matter how small or simple it was, the wonder and joy that came from that simple thing was something I really clicked with. So, living almost 20 years after this idea first existed, why have I seen nothing anywhere close to the level of love this had?Just to make sure I’m being fair, I opened up Honkai Star Rail to see what they wrote me:*“Ashley, you must have already guessed what Pop-Pom is about to say. Happy! Birthday!Your birthday is listed as 4/11 on the Trailblaze Calendar—As conductor of the Astral Express, Pom-Pom knows this date by heart! Here’s a cake that everyone on the Express made for you. Welt and March 7th did the decorations, and Himeko and Dan Heng were in charge of the recipe…and Pom-Pom supervised. We promise that it’s tasty! We hope that, after you’ve walked the span of the entire universe, you can still remember every stop you made. This year, let’s make more happy memories together!One more time, happy birthday, Passenger Ashley!”*With nothing but 3 text inputs and mostly a completely non-committal message of only characters that are introduced within the first chapter, the message leave me with 100 Stellar Jades (which isn’t even enough for a single pull on a banner) as well as a “Wayfarer’s Blessing,” a slightly different stylized cake than the “First Voyage’s Blessing” I obtained during my first birthday with the game. The rewards are unsubstantial and the message is somehow less loving than one from a massive toy corporation appealing to kids that didn’t know better, which means that things haven’t progressed in a single way. I’m sure if I did a little more research or had a bit more childlike wonder there could be a bit of joy in some game out there, but I refuse to do that much work today.And maybe part of this is intended—a parasocial message from a game doesn’t sound like it’d make getting older feel any better. I know there’s the question of if it is worth it when people put in fake birthdays or can try to exploit it for rewards, but as long as obvious systems are in place the freedom to choose whatever birthday someone would prefer would just mean they can choose a day that rewards them even if they’d rather it wasn’t their birthday. The connection others feel to their games can obviously feel much less personal to them, and I don’t want to illustrate this point as something I believe in wrong with gaming. I don’t really care—like most other birthday messages, I’ll forget about it before the day is over. I do think there’s something important to discuss, even if I don’t really want to unpack it fully today. The way that large corporations and large general appeal causes some of the intimacy and connection of various traits of media and games to disappear is apparent, not just during this day but the other 364. It’s something to idly think about as I take a break today.But if a game wants to know my birthday, the least they can do is send me a gift card."

    "content": "Digital ownership sucks, especially as we move into a place in which time frames are getting longer between the release dates of video games. Even if it doesn’t affect me directly, I don’t love it.Today’s topic once again comes from my research, a particular thing that gets me thinking about the bigger picture of something in gaming. I would hate to become a writer that posts daily “How to get x in y game” articles with tiny updates, so I attempt to tackle bigger themes that stem from current events. It was that mindset that lead me to seeing this article about Ubisoft’s “The Crew” being shut down. I remember finding and sending the article to my friend and saying, in confidence, “I know what my next article is about.”(also, I will now be doing my best to link things now that I set up a system. I’ll be going back through the older articles and putting links in. I said I couldn’t use any work I did before April, but I never said I couldn’t go back and edit things. Still within the rules of my challenge!)Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter does a great work covering the issue in this and her previous article—in short, “The Crew” was a live service racing game released by Ubisoft in December 2014, and they made the move to shut the servers down and render the game unplayable in 2024 due to it having no offline mode. Even with a refund to recent buyers, it still left a lot of people losing a game that they paid for. A lawsuit was filed against Ubisoft, and more recently had a response from Ubisoft who doubled down on their decision by attempting to dismiss the case. According to Ubisoft, the players were rightfully warned that their purchase was solely a borrowing of the software.It’s here that we come to a major issue with online gaming—the way in which we interact with games and software is a form of ownership that isn’t related to a car or bed, but instead is more akin to renting or loaning. Games are given out as software that you don’t have the rights to but are able to use within the intended form. This is why code can be obfuscated and modifications such as cheats are a breach of the terms of service—by playing these games and using these products, you have to follow a set of rules that is associated.All of the things illustrated above are reasonable and fair to a certain extent—without some of the outlined features, a game’s code and design can be stolen or abused in ways that are unfair to creators. In that same way, it allows for a strict ruling against modification that is actively against the spirit or competitive nature of a game. If you were to own a game in the same way you owned a car, certain concepts such as reselling it as an online software that is theoretically infinite would be problematic for the industry.I write these because I want to be able to contrast them with the issues that are additionally provided through digital ownership. Apart from the above example of the recent moves that have occurred with Ubisoft, there’s the eerie note that your steam account is not an “inheritable” object. Digital ownership is complex and leaves us with a lot of cases of unfair practices that will likely need to be reconsidered as we move into the future. With the restriction of modifications also comes the reasonable complaints around mods, especially ones for accessibility or improving framerate and rendering that don’t impede any part of the original game but are still restricted by the need to protect the digital rights of the game. The terms of service of every online game leaves us tied on what we can and cannot do, even if we may disagree.The issue is incredibly complicated when we also refer to the willingness of gamers to accept this level of ownership. With systems like Xbox GamePass as of recent that allow for the more open renting of games, some people even trade off their level of ownership of a product in order to spend less money on games. These systems are like renting or borrowing games from friends, but I’m sure a lot of us have had reservations about the feelings of doing these things with personal possessions in the past. The difference between owning something and using something is apparent, and contextualizing gaming with it won’t be the most fun feeling in the world.Even though the issues don’t always become serious problems for me, I recognize the pain it inflicts at times. As a Destiny 2 player, I was caught up in the swarm of anger that arose from the Destiny Content Vault and their sunsetting of old content. The fight of losing previous content that was purchased with the intent of using it without a consideration for the tiny fine print sucks because, in theory, we all read and understand that the terms of service explains to us that we don’t have the power we would normally have with something like a car or bed. And as time goes forwards and we create bigger gaps between the starting of live service games that will eventually go defunct, the industry has to come to a proper conclusion of how they’re going to move forward in order to provide trust in the ways that corporations care for their consumers.So if you’re enjoying a niche online game you’ve had since you were young, hold onto it. You might not get another chance."

    "content": "Talking about leaks is a hard thing to do, especially as they begin getting more specific even before we’ve discussed whether or not the first details we’ve received are real.I’ve been reading up a lot of various articles looking for reasonably interesting things to cover—talking about simple updates or the small changes in games is a pretty hard sell when it comes to writing an engaging article. Still, I look for pieces of “small” news because there are often some larger questions behind it. That brings me to today’s piece—a leaker by the twitter handle of @Osvaldatore tweeted out a list of “Titanfall 3 Info,” today, with a focus on some of the details in production. Osvaldatore claims that Titanfall 3 is “Almost Complete,” as well as specifying details about the game using Unreal Engine 5 and the modes available for play. The details come relatively sincerely—the post is not a joke, and Osvaldatore mentions in a reply that their, “Source is 100% sure about everything [they were] told minus the announcement/release dates, which [they] conveniently left out for this reason.”I bring this up not because I’m very interested in the development of a new game by Respawn Entertainment, but because I thought about the ethics of reporting on something like this. I checked the poster and found that they were frequent leakers, as well as looking up various other articles to see how trustworthy they found this post. Even so, not a single trusted person can tell me without a doubt that Titanfall 3 is a real game that is on the way without the caveat of “leaks.” The information that is being shared is something actively withheld by people within a black box, a space of unknown that we cannot see into due to the secrecy of the work in the company. This is, of course, reasonable and occurs often. Games are developed in secrecy in the beginning because of the tendency to scrap or change things while in early planning phases—if you’ve created anything, I’m sure you’ve had ideas that simply don’t make it off the first piece of paper. This privacy with early ideas is reasonable and something I wish to respect, as well as something I would like with my own work if I was to be dealing with a long term project.It’s for this reason that I struggle with the discussion of leaks—there’re a lot of games that are plagued by frequent leakers and data-miners to the point in which the upcoming content is almost a free flowing discussion despite the unfinished nature. Hoyoverse’s Honkai Star Rail has a sort of test build that has information of upcoming characters, and friends and I often use videos of it to judge whether or not we should be saving up our stellar jades for future banners. This information is relatively reliable when we’re a month or two out from the release of these banners, but droplets of far away leaks for characters such as Sunday’s early teasers that were many months before his banner’s first appearance. These leaks are much more unreliable and often contain whispers of a character that barely translate to the future release, and often may be of characters that could never release. I’m sorry to do this to the wanters, but Screwllum is a character that has been “leaked” often for over a year and has yet to find his way into a main release. Game files and voice lines can easily be created noncommittally and then abandoned, leaving red herrings for data-miners that cause information that is untrue to spread quickly through social media.It’s this experience with leaks that gives me my perspective on Titanfall 3’s suspected engine—while the information surrounding Unreal Engine 5 is already unstable considering the experiences that gamers associate with it, would-be byers are now voicing concerns over it despite the fact that the information is unconfirmed and only let out through a leaker with an unknown source. To reiterate, people are upset about their unsupported complaints about an unconfirmed engine used to make a game we don’t even have confirmation is a real existing project. The information that we’re dealing with is such a strangely empty promise that people take as a reason to determine the results of the game’s launch sales despite us, once again, not knowing if the game is real. The discussion is strange no matter the likelihood of Respawn Entertainment creating a new Titanfall after the success of Titanfall 2, the likelihood of the leaker’s source being truthful with their information, or the likelihood of issues to be created due to the use of Unreal Engine 5.While there’s a level of discussion to be had around leaks, the damage it can deal to a game’s reputation before launch can be unnecessarily harmful. If Titanfall 3 is to release one day and be using a different engine than Unreal Engine 5, there could likely be people who blame issues with the game based on the idea they have that it was built using it. It isn’t possible to police random strangers on the internet and tell them to be careful with their words on a product still in flux, but I believe there has to at least be a standard of discussion surrounding trusted sources and journalists. I know that what I’m currently doing is still an amateur level of coverage and my reach is minimal as of current, but I want to make note of this topic to hopefully help people thinking about what a leak’s value holds within the gaming sphere.Anyways, this article was just a vessel for me to say that if Titanfall 3 is coming out I’ll buy that shit on launch."

    "content": "I’ve been pretty upset with the state of AAA gaming with the pricing increase and the rather shaky launches, but my time with a couple February releases this year has given me a couple reasons to try and stay positive.I worry a lot about the state of gaming with some of the turns it takes, but I think that taking a step back and giving a look from some other perspectives can help curb my fears. This is, of course, not to be used to excuse things like crunch time in development and greedy microtransactions in games that have plagued gaming for most of the 21st century. The story today comes courtesy of two big hits during February that came at $70 price tags—Sid Meier’s Civilization 7 and Monster Hunter Wilds.The two games came out far enough together that I had a good amount of time to play them both, but their same month release date meant it was a really bad hit to my budget. Fortunately, I was kindly gifted Civilization 7 by a friend (more on that later). The two games are a very good example of what I imagined when hearing $70 games and were emblematic of the problems I always mentioned—buggy, unoptimized, and borderline unfinished. I held the stance that a game at $70 should feel polished and full—in my eyes, the game’s full price tag is a sign that the game should meet a high standard of quality. Games like Elden Ring deserved their price tag, and other AAA games failed to hit their mark.It was Civilization 7 that finally got me to change this perspective as I learned how my stance could be actively challenged. It was due to how I received Civilization 7—even if I was willing to break the bank on release to play the game with friends, I was gifted the game by my friend. The most important detail for this is that this friend is a developer on the team that shipped Civilization 7, which intrinsically changed my way of interacting with the product. In the traditional way, receiving a gift obviously makes me want to play it so that I don’t squander the generosity. It also, however, brought my anti-$70 stance to question as I mentioned directly when explaining it in a group chat discussing the game. The game’s release was shaky—with the natural dooming from fans over the game’s changes and how much worse it was than previous entries in the series also came a sweep of bugs and missing features that earned the game’s “Mixed” reviews on Steam. It was the exact thing that I argued was an issue with the $70 price tag on all games and why I never purchased any $70 games—the issue now is that this was directly opposed by a developer on the team that shipped the game.A large level of topics and various details about what I believe in games was challenged, and since then I’ve changed. A note I made was on the classic “day-one patch” in which a game would receive a rapid bug fix within the first 24 hours to address crashes or broken features that were impossible to ignore. I am barely old enough to remember the first time this was publicized heavily—one of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed games that was ridiculed heavily for the need for something so soon to make the game playable. I criticized it as a lazy solution to the issue of incomplete testing and lacking QA, but my friend noted that a lot of these patches are simply to the benefit of players and a product of technology allowing for this to be possible. With the power of how well our hardware and infrastructure has gotten, the ability to push frequent updates as soon as issues are apparent is a helpful tool for devs that want a lot of these issues to be fixed as soon as they can. While some amount of issue still lies with the publisher and the need to produce a finished product, the developers are still working as hard as they do in order to create the product they’ve been enjoying building. It’s that mentality that made me realize that, despite minor bugs and unavoidable visual issues, I really enjoyed my time in Civilization 7. I’ve logged over 100 hours in the game and had numerous joyous moments shared with the friends who join me for long marathon game nights. Despite the issues, the game was incredibly fun. And, with each patch from the devoted devs, the game will become better and better.I want to highlight how Monster Hunter Wilds fits into this as well—as a game I specifically purchased at $70, it also held a certain standard of expectation that I held for it. As a testing of my new perspective, the game’s enjoyment was enough to get me to a similar playtime as I did with Civilization 7. The issue was the game’s optimization, something that many have criticized after the shift to a dynamic weather system and open map that requires a lot of space to be loaded and managed. The frame rate issues were something I worked on for a long time to get a stable experience, but even then I learned to enjoy the game that I had paid for. The updates that came didn’t improve my performance by significant margins, but I still had an enjoyable time hunting monsters at a shaky 50 fps.While these experiences are nowhere close to universal, it gave me a more gentle perspective on the issue. While I don’t forgive some publishers for their greed and the way they can rush projects out without a completed product, I have a lot more respect for the developers behind a game and don’t turn my head away from a $70 experience just from a couple of negative reviews. My stance is a lot more complex, something I take pride in as we move into this year of gaming and I find myself more in control of my financial situation. While I take a price tag into consideration, I no longer allow it to rule my direction when it comes to purchasing games. As I’ve said before, some of the best games of our time are $20 and don’t have the issues I’ve mentioned in this article. While those experiences are amazing and I want to enjoy as many of them as I can, it’s unfair to reject the work of a lot of developers just because of the price tag. I understand this position comes from a level of privilege based on my ability to purchase $70 games as well as being gifted some, but the discussion of $70 games does need to be more nuanced in order to properly illustrate the issues that come from it as well as the benefits that can spawn.But I still think if you haven’t you should spent the $20 and play Celeste as soon as possible."

    "content": "Watching “A Minecraft Movie” was bad enough to make me reconsider being overly positive—but a good night’s sleep and a conversation reminded me why I shouldn’t be hateful.If you know me, you know that I’m a pretty generous person when it comes to praise. Even with contentious media that many people use as the butt end of jokes, like Fortnite or Five Nights at Freddy’s, I find a way to stay positive. In addition, I’m pretty often found playing subpar games or enjoying slop media, such as my urge to watch low count videos that I’m recommended or my current playtime in Fortnite Ranked Ballistics (and if you don’t know what it is, just imagine a roblox recreation of CS:GO). The general idea is that if you’re looking for someone to bear with you through a horrible television show for an unreasonable amount of time, then I’m your girl.And then I watched “A Minecraft Movie” yesterday with a couple of friends.In my opinion, the movie is quite possibly one of the worst things I’d ever watched. The pacing is ruined by an almost 30 minute exposition period for a 90 minute runtime that requires the rest of the development to feel rushed, as well as suffering from poorly written dialogue that puts the characters on stilts and fitting them into cartoonish stereotypes. The jokes are often dated and incredibly easy to anticipate, as well as the references being devoid of love for the source material. The ending of the story (spoilers ahead, obviously. Although it isn’t unexpected) is confusing—with a hero’s journey set with the Minecraft world, you’d anticipate the ending of them returning to their original world. However, no push is provided to encourage this—the Minecraft world proves rather safe in comparison to what you’d expect, and all the characters lack familial or personal motivation to return to a world that had beaten them down. With a freely open portal and plenty of reasons to stay or even return to the Overworld, the main characters instead opt to return solely to the real world, even convincing Steve to leave after his extended stay. I can write a massive, scathing review of this movie as a failure of media. I considered as much before I went to bed.This morning, I woke up to a text thread from some friends who enjoyed their watch.It was this that got me to curb my response to a point as I discussed it with them. I still presented my arguments and my personal issues with the film, but they also had an opportunity to share the things they enjoyed during their theater experience. It was their perspective that made me realize that even though I wanted to enjoy the movie, the failure to have that enjoyment was not inherently a failure of the movie. These friends were given a couple other benefits to their experience—they enjoyed a theater of happy kids that were enjoying the references and laughing often, but my experience was only a couple of friends who were all in less cheerful moods. The perspectives we had were very different in ways that I realized I couldn’t replicate, which brings me to what I really realized thinking about my movie experience.The situations of every media are different, but that goes for every person regardless of personality. The situation and time and surroundings towards an experience can always change the way that we interact with it and will inevitably leave everyone with different impressions, something that means that even people with very similar tastes can end up coming away with conflicting opinions. I think that my opinion on “A Minecraft Movie” can be reasonable and valid, but the opinion cannot be the end of the explanations of the movie. Even if my opinions can be developed in a less biased way that applied more objectively, the objective review of “A Minecraft Movie” still cannot change the subjective experience of someone who enjoyed it more than the objective stance would have led them to believe. With the abstraction of my subjective opinion towards another’s, there’s many different factors that lead someone to enjoy what I didn’t or hate what I did. It’s a reminder to myself as to why I work to be positive towards media as often as I can.Because like we’ve all been taught, it costs nothing to be a kind person. While the abstraction of experience and subjective opinion can make something good or bad depending on the person, there’s no downsides to showing positive opinions of something compared to being negative about it. It was something I learned picking up Destiny 2—there’s a thousand people out there that’ll talk about how much they hate it and how dumb it is and that the mechanics are awful. These people, some of whom I’ve had telling me this during play sessions where they are also playing, do nothing but make the experience of enjoying something I like more embarrassing and awkward. Expressing negativity is an intrinsic trait we find easy to do, but the actual benefit of it is way more nuanced and infrequent than positivity.So even if I have a very negative view of “A Minecraft Movie,” I really am happy that people got to have a good time with it. I’m glad that the movie brought a lot of joy, and I’m sure there will be plenty of memes and other cultural references that we’ll all be able to laugh about as we wait for a sequel. I’m going to work on being even more positive—I want to vocalize my opinions every so often, but I always want to lean on the side of positivity as opposed to my negative experiences. I’d encourage you all to do the same—ranting on about things you didn’t like about a show or game might make you feel a bit better, but there’s a chance people don’t agree and your perspective will make them feel worse for enjoying something that you didn’t. No matter the state of the world, people deserve to feel joy in their lives about things they enjoy.And I’ll be honest, that second knife did make me laugh pretty hard."

    "content": "With some of the recent news of games being “too easy,” I’m recognizing a pretty negative sentiment that does nothing but reduce the accessibility of gaming.I think it’s pretty clear from other articles I write that I care a lot about what accessibility in gaming means, and I want to illustrate it with a recent development going on that concerns Monster Hunter Wilds. The critically acclaimed action rpg has been often criticized for being “too easy” by followers of the franchise, citing simplified mechanics and shorter hunts due to the new “wounds” system. I believe this very common complaint has been recently snuffed out with the newest Title Update introducing some powerful fights to the game, but the sentiment remains—the game is “too easy.”I went looking for more discussion around this, especially considering the cult following that Monster Hunter has with die-hard fans who sink hours and hours into the game. I’ve seen mention of friends who’ve seen their buddies with no prior experience clearing endgame hunts with little preparation and a lot of citations from veterans who call this the easiest game in the franchise, which is always a pretty scathing review. I will note that a lot of the more negative opinions regarding this come from long term fans of the franchise while those with less experience mention that, even while easy, the game is fun and satisfying. So, what’s the reality?Let me start by mentioning this: My first Monster Hunter game was World, released in 2018 that I played on and off till I reached a 30 hour playtime. I played Rise a couple times with friends, achieving similar playtime until Wilds was released. There, with my very experienced friends and some time to kill, I completed the game’s Eastward Wings achievement (the 100%) as well as sunk a solid 100 hours into the game within the first month. I have no doubt that I’m still a casual player in the eyes of some, but I’d like to think my experience holds some weight within the conversation of difficulty. With that said, I can say this:At hunter rank 160 I carted to a non-tempered Blangonga.The conversation that a game is “too easy” always confuses me because there has never been a game in my life that was so easy that it was a problem. Even as I begin to optimize my gameplay and find myself at a point that a game is becoming easier after my skill is improving, the reason the game is not “too easy” is because the actual difficulty of the game is never changing. This is what I believe is the disconnect—as players get better at games and achieve this coveted “gamer” position in which they have an intrinsic talent for specific genres, they begin to conflate their improving skill with that of the game’s difficulty. Games aren’t getting “easier” with their newest installments—you’re just better at them. It’s up to a player to understand that they’re getting better and if they want to do anything about it.Allow me to explain: when I carted to the non-tempered Blangonga, I was playing on stream with a group of friends who were new to high rank. As such, I tossed away my armor and put on a set of rarity 6 gear in order to avoid ruining the fun by killing the monster too quickly. This lack of defense and a less optimal build, in combination with my hubris, caused me to forget to heal and take a fatal gorilla strike to the face. It was embarrassing and silly–-but it was fun. If I had simply kept a set of guardian arkveld armor and a +5 artian weapon on while running around with these players, I would have surely kept my health up and never had to deal with the shame of riding back to the fight as the others continued to wail on the weakened monster. My choice to reduce my gear’s power was a very particular one—in order to make the game harder, I made choices to hinder myself and bring a bit more challenge to my fights.This level of difficulty selection in games is something that exists everywhere, and the beauty of playing this way is having more control over what challenges you face. Some players I know in Monster Hunter avoid optimizing weapons or armor for the sake of finding a good looking set of gear to show off in pictures, ignoring skills to instead focus on being pretty. This is—however unintentional—a form of difficulty selection. Avoiding game mechanics is a great way to change your experience, something that extends from never using a class in an mmo that you think would make things easy to never leveling up in an rpg. It’s a form of difficulty selection players do for particular challenge runs that doesn’t have to function as “impressive” to be a worthwhile endeavor—if you want to play Monster Hunter Wilds without ever eating food, there’s no youtube audience you have to please in order to get the ok to do so.If one doesn’t want to hinder themselves from using game mechanics, challenging oneself to find faster or more efficient methods of completing tasks is still a form of difficulty selection. Watching people meticulously build a damage dealing machine in Monster Hunter to take down hunts in under a minute or seeing a solo insect glaive player take down a tempered arkveld without a scratch on them are both feats of skill that any person can partake in attempting. The decisions people are able to make to create fun challenges are endless—for example, consider the millions of ways that people have beaten games by FromSoftware such as on guitar hero controllers or even back to back without taking hits. If a game is “too easy,” the words shouldn’t be used to complain. They should be an inspiration to boot up and find new ways to challenge yourself.And I note these things because the solution cannot just be to make games harder. For a lot of people (myself included when I started in Monster Hunter Wilds), the lower ranks are still a pretty hard journey. I had a triple-cart on the first Rey Dau after having to learn that my ability to dodge a railgun isn’t what it used to be, and my armor had to be tweaked once coming in contact with the guardian monsters during the final act of the main story. To call this game “too easy” is to dismiss the failures of people to reasonably tuned experiences and simply avoid discussing that a reasonable discrepancy of skill can exist between new players and veterans. Monster Hunter Wilds is tuned for a middle ground of helping new players enjoy the experience as well as giving resistance to people who are still finding their footing. If it were tuned solely for the diehard fanbase, there’d be a large portion of players who couldn’t make it past the early ranks. This concept links to accessibility, including features that are introduced to allow for players to enjoy the games in the way they wish to. The seikret’s auto riding (something mentioned as a feature that simplified the game by removing the issue of monster tracking) is a toggle that can be actively turned off with the up button on the D-pad. For anyone who doesn’t want to use it or believe it makes the game “too easy,” they always had the option to track the monster the old fashioned way. In the words of the Doom twitter account, “You control the buttons you press.” Adding other accessibility features such as visual indicators for noise or auto-clicking for holding buttons can be helpful for those who require it and actively ignored for people who might think it removes the challenge of the games.The solution to Monster Hunter Wilds’s difficulty problem isn’t with the need for Elder Dragons or a 9-star tempered monster, but in players needing to understand how they want to interact with their games. Honing skills and getting better is an intrinsic part of any talent. In those talents, it’s up to the person whether or not they want to improve their ability for the purpose of getting faster or if they want to challenge themselves with harder tasks or impediments. Gaming is the same—you can continue to practice your aim or improve execution with the intent of being better, but to bring the challenge back from your earlier days of picking up a controller is going to require being creative.So get out there and beat that Zoh Shia with a full team of rarity 1 greatswords. Show ‘em who’s boss."

    "content": "In the spirit of spreading joy through these articles, I’d like to highlight the 3 hidden gems of my steam library I can’t stop talking about.If you’re a friend or in similar circles, these games may appear obvious because I’ve mentioned them or forced others to play them. I still consider them as hidden gems because they’re indie games that didn’t hit the levels of success that our titans of the industry such as Balatro and Undertale hit. The following 3 games are all affordable, easy to run on any hardware, and are inviting to newcomers to gaming as well as frequent players. If you haven’t played a game on this list, I can do nothing but recommend it to you within this article as well as any conversation we have concerning topics involved. Let us begin, in no particular order, with:I Am Your BeastThis fast-paced FPS speedrunning shooter is a phenomenal thriller by Strange Scaffold, headed by the incredible writer and director Xalavier Nelson Jr. With crazy past projects such as El Paso, Elsewhere and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, there’s likely at least one name on his resume that you’ll recognize for its innovative style. I am Your Beast plays as a level-based speedrun style game, giving players a task and inviting them to hone a path to cut as much time as possible off their journey from point A to point B. With extra points and time awarded for stylish moves and a satisfying amount of hitstop and aim assist to sell the trained ex-soldier main character of Alphonse Harding, the journey is unparalleled even by similar games such as the earlier Neon White. As an advocate for Neon White’s incredible story and stylistic choices, I find that I Am Your Beast leans a bit tighter into the speedrunning roots of execution and corner-cutting for its expectations of the player while Neon White often wants you to solve the puzzle of what the correct path has to be in order to achieve its best rank. While there’s many paths in both games, I Am Your Beast demands retry after retry if it’s to reward the player with the coveted top ranks. While both games are good, I Am Your Beast is on a whole other level.And part of that is the story, interspersed between stages in the form of audio between its characters. Xalavier Nelson Jr. himself plays Harding, a main character with unbelievable wit that mixes flawlessly with his apathetic nature. It lends itself to an incredible opening tutorial scene that I’ve replayed 4 times just to show to various people and lure them into playing the game for themselves, a chilling sequence where amazing voice work lends itself to the beginning of a promising tale. And it is—a story of government military action and one man’s struggle to break free of the violence in a story that, while entirely impossible to relate to physically given the context, still functions as a deeply engaging story that transforms into a beautiful emotional ride that leaves me feeling tearful by the end. Various lines of the story make their way into my vocabulary as I laugh to myself everytime they come back up in dialogue. So please, give yourself the pleasure of enjoying the story and gameplay in I Am Your Beast for $20 on Steam.“I’m whittling a bird out of soap, Charles. I don’t know what kind of bird it is because I’m new to whittling, but it’s…some kind of bird. The only thing keeping me from my bird shaped object is you sending another company of motherfuckers into my home. This can end whenever you decide.”Tiny RoguesTiny Rogues is another fast-paced game, a top down bullet hell action roguelite that transcends any other I’ve played in the genre. I’m not a big fan of roguelites, but I play quite a few looking for ones that’ll rope me in—Hades, Risk of Rain, Balatro, Inscription, Enter the Gungeon—more than I’d guess the average person would. Of all of them, with the exception of Balatro and maybe Hades, I would put Tiny Rogues at the top. With a bullet hell style game that brings me a fantastic joy in moment-to-moment combat as well as a massive collection of new weapons and gear to make every run unique, the game immediately climbed to a 90 hour playtime as I hunted all of its 86 achievements down. Its first runs are much easier than typical roguelikes, giving you a win over Death in what could be your first or second playthrough. It’s then that the game slowly begins opening up—starting meta progression a lot faster than other games in the genre and allowing you to choose your own levels of difficulty that allows for a modular experience that’ll give you the challenge you want regardless of your skill level. While I Am Your Beast achieved excellence in story, Tiny Rogues holds a personal space in my heart for its buildcrafting and mechanical design.Inspired by some of the greatest games of all time such as Dark Souls and Terraria, stat scaling and mechanics are tuned and optimized for a clear experience that creates incredible options for building a character. With 34 playable characters with unique skills, the game’s weapons and gear all effectively keyword their abilities and provide a lot of clarity as to how things will function in tandem. This clarity is what creates a fluid build crafting experience—with full information on the gear and notes that appear to explain their particular triggers and effects, you can easily ascertain how your gear will work together and easily plan ahead with the choice of focusing on keywords and compounding effects. I find that other games require lots of alternative websites or prior legacy knowledge in order to get a hang of their systems, but Tiny Rogues manages to give it all to the player without overloading them with information. So please, enjoy Tiny Rogues for $10 on steam and see how far you get before those fatal words appear once more on your screen.“Death claims another.”[Bad End Theaterdef3Band End Theater is a narrative visual novel with multiple endings—a smaller playtime than the former games, but a story that’s brought me to tears multiple times and leads me to fall in love with its characters. In it, Tragedy invites you to a theater of stories that follows a simple theme—every story ends with a bad ending. You’ll direct 4 characters through a play, exploring the endings in a choose your own adventure style format with plenty of ways to see these characters meet tragic ends. The game is about 2 hours in length for a full playthrough, something I’d highly recommend for its $10 price tag. Give it a play with 3 other friends and let them laugh and cry alongside you, looking for each ending of the 41 provided (and don’t worry, there’s a map to help you along).While I’d love to sell this even more to you, the game is best enjoyed entirely blind. I can still mention the incredible pixel art and phenomenal writing, but despite the game’s unassuming appearance there are a lot of details I want to avoid sharing to allow you to enjoy the full experience. If you’ve trusted me on the previous two entries in this article, I highly recommend giving me enough trust to check this one out on Steam. As one last teaser, I’ll give you a small detail I’d like to keep in your mind. There’s one lyric track in the game’s soundtrack, reserved for the true ending and made with the voice of SynthV’s Eleanor Forte. I request that you wait to hear it in game, but I’ll leave you with its first verse:“To the lost, the cold;Take your seats everyoneWelcome to Bad End Theater!When the curtains close,You come away strongerOr maybe you’ll breakNot my fault you sought this pain.Share in my miseryFor all eternityLabyrinth of suffering.”So please, if you haven’t played a game on this list and one of them seems particularly intriguing, pick it up on Steam and give it a try this weekend."

    "content": "Of every announcement to get me locked into my screen, it had to be Toby Fox’s Deltarune trailer.This is a shorter article, but I wanted to cover something that had nothing but pure joy and love behind it. While articles I write often want to discuss specific complex topics or issues I have, I wanted a time to simply put something wonderful onto a pedestal and praise it. That thing is the Nintendo Switch 2 trailer for Deltarune, revealed on April 2nd to give us the release of chapters 3 and 4—June 5th, 2025.For the unfamiliar, Deltarune is the second game by Toby Fox, the video game developer and composer that was the genius behind the indie RPG Undertale. Deltarune’s first chapter was released in 2018, the second in 2021, and now with two more available later this year. The game follows 3 heroes saving their world and another from various mysterious forces—an adventure full of laughter and mystery as things continue to unravel. I’d say more, but this paragraph was intended for those of you who haven’t played it. If you’ve yet to experience Undertale or Deltarune, please take today to begin installing and playing the game. It’s ok, this article will be here for when you come back.For anyone following Toby Fox, I’m sure you’re as excited as I am. Which is why I audibly screamed while watching a small white dog scamper onto screen on a black background during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. While learning a release date was obviously an exciting moment, I want to highlight the beauty in the trailer’s design that moved me beyond anything I’d seen in recent memory.We all have trailers that we hold dear to our heart—gripping memories or powerful imagery that, regardless of the game’s final release, we find ourselves returning to. For those curious, mine are (in no particular order) the staple Dead Island Official Announcement Trailer, the Destiny 2: Lightfall Launch Trailer from the Playstation State of Play, and the Bulletstorm: Full Clip Launch Trailer that introduced me to the music artist Krewella. Of these, I failed to play 2 of these games and the last was a tonal contrast to the love I had from the trailer. With this new Deltarune trailer joining the ranks of these 3, I’m excited to finally have a touching trailer for a source material I will enjoy thoroughly.I mean, I did end up enjoying Lightfall. It’s pretty solid. People are just haters.The Deltarune trailer follows a similar theme of simple pixel art and black background with simple describing words, but even here there’s a deceptively unique detail going on. As they introduce us to Kris, Suzie, and Ralsei, the trailer shows us an animation that, I believe, is not present within the games as we know it (I don’t say this with confidence because even now, 7 years later, people forget that the party joining jingle I use as a stream notification was present in the first chapter). Kris lifting Suzie up from her hand is a powerful vision that reminds me of their slowly growing friendship from bully and victim turned party members. As it isn’t mimicked with Ralsei, a character’s origin who is still shrouded in mystery, I can only imagine that this animation will be seen as the two continue to work together in the coming chapters.As the music hits the chorus, we see gameplay that swaps from familiar to unfamiliar with old memories and new fights. As scared as I usually am with spoilers pertaining to these games within trailers, it’s hard to not notice the same love being poured into these chapters as the previous work Toby Fox has put in. The unique gunslinger costumes they’re put in as the player is seemingly aiming for an ACT minigame, the wonderful 4 frame animation of Suzie banging on the drums, and all the new minigames and different playstyles we’re seeing that transcend anything we’ve seen before all give me hope for a new level of incredible storytelling and humor. The shift in my emotion that brings this from a great trailer to one of the best is in the final moments—as the chorus approaches an ending, a small music shift I only noticed on my second watch switches from the standard familiar theme to an orchestrated rendition that immediately captures my attention whether I notice it or not. We get another reminder of where we’ve been—A scuffle with King and a showdown with Queen in chapters 1 and 2. With each beat, we move forward—A look at the static-y foe coming to chapter 3 and a rather non-committal scene for chapter 4 (which I appreciate, spoilers in trailers are lame). It finally ends with a beautifully animated cutscene of our heroes facing off a cliff towards the climactic words of the trailer—”Deltarune is waiting.”I don’t have any fancy college-educated analysis for the trailer and why it’s so good. It just feels good. It is emblematic of the love and joy that comes from indie creators as they show off the best facets of their work and deliver to their fans a beautiful product. There’s no fancy graphics or performance reveals—it’s simply a story of friendship and humor given to us in a satisfying way, leaving us with a 2 month wait for an exciting continuation of the fantastic work from Toby Fox. Once again, there’s no meaning to this article—it’s just appreciation for a beautiful moment in gaming.And the game isn’t even out yet."

    "content": "When things come down to money, I always have to step back and look at just what the cost is—not just in dollars, but in impact too.Our discussion is courtesy once again of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, revealing the console would be priced at $449 (450, let’s be honest) on its launch later this year. For those who aren’t keeping track, this is their most expensive console since the $350 Wii U and the $300 Switch 1. Most of the beloved ones, like the Wii and 3DS, were around $250 (although we’ll discuss that later). The large gap is obviously a steep price point—improved hardware and increased demand are obvious sources, but I want to look at more of the details that come from these price increases. For that, I’ll go off script from what most articles are discussing and cross reference a few things to begin.Our original Xbox 360 dropped at $399 and the PS3 was $499 at launch. This is a stark contrast to their current prices for their modern counterparts at $499 and $699 respectively. I bring this up not to illustrate a pattern to excuse Nintendo of their actions, but to explain the way in which prices can be normalized. With how sparsely we interact with the prices for consoles, the slow increases can be slipped in and normalized as standard practice. Another example that I noticed and inspired this train of thought: Controllers. While the standard wireless Xbox 360 controller retailed for $40 and the Dualshock 3 for $55-60, the Xbox Series X controller now retails for $60 and the Dualsense a hefty $75. Of course, I’d be a fool not to mention the uptick in AAA games going from a $60 to $70 price tag, with Mario Kart World for the Switch 2 now rising to $80.I understand that inflation or improved technology can be a major factor when it comes to price changes like this, and I want to note that while I move into this article. I’ve had my discussions with various people on some of these things, and I do want to attribute a part of these prices toward unchangeable factors.This comes with the caveat that a cheap or refurbished laptop costs $200, an 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller costs $30, and a copy of Celeste costs $20 when it’s not on sale (like it was yesterday).Gaming is universal, and hardware and peripherals are only so important when it comes to the sweep of simple and small indie and classic games. And my estimates weren’t skimping on anything—the laptop might be rather variable, but the Ultimate 2C is probably one of the best controllers on the market and Celeste as a game isn’t even my cheapest example of a peak in gaming that doesn’t require crazy hardware. Sure, the experiences of Monster Hunter Wilds and Helldivers 2 are locked behind graphics cards and Bloodborne and Mario Party are hidden behind console exclusives, but they’re a drop in the ocean compared to some of the experiences free and accessible to everyone.With these details, I really want to explore what the price increase really affects—the perception of the value of gaming in terms of money towards other corporations. Competition and pricing in a capitalist society is much more complex than just “supply and demand,” but let me put it this way—when you consider what a “full priced” game is, what do you say?Maybe you say $70? If it were me, I’d still firmly say $60. Others might be only willing to say $40. But with the release of an $80 base game with the Switch 2, we could see this number continue to rise. While indie devs struggle to make competitive pricing in a sea of a market, the expected budget and production costs as well as the value expected to be made is rising steadily in the AAA game’s market. More detail, more levels, more maps, and more content as the games are more demanding on hardware and space. Gaming is getting bigger—a size difference that has now been punctuated by the $450 console successor to one of the most successful in history. We stand here, in limbo between announcement and debut of this console, and have no say but to watch as it hits markets and possibly sets a new market price.There’s a way this works out—longtime followers of Nintendo might remember that the 3DS was not priced at $250 forever. In July of 2011 the console’s price was reduced drastically to $170, promising a sweep of retro games to those who purchased it at full price previously. This was done, presumably, because the steep price caused a decrease in sales and potential profit. The issue is that many people will likely purchase it regardless—previous Switch owners who have faith in the console enough to purchase it at the new price or families during the upcoming christmas. These people are not the enemy, and anyone should be allowed to purchase the console at its price without guilt. The issue is with the form in which this price tag will set industry standards and cause a ripple effect to increase prices around the world. This is linked to the uneven regional prices that people have to deal with—the increase in price in Canada or the UK in comparison to the United States due to currency differences. Pricing and choices don’t just change availability—they hinder accessibility. While we can direct people towards cheaper methods of gaming (as seen above with my $250 example), marketing and name brand priority will turn people away from being able to enjoy experiences like we’ve all come to love in gaming.So consider your purchase of the Nintendo Switch 2 when it releases this June—not out of guilt, but out of a curiosity towards what is going on within the industry. Enjoy the time spent with this new era of gaming, but I inspire you to help share the experience with others that might not have the chance. This isn’t just in recommending budget gaming options like I did, but in also inviting others to join you on the couch for some local play.I referenced my privilege to own as many consoles as I did in my youth, and both me and my brother were friends with people from underprivileged parts of our city who weren’t able to afford the experiences we did. We both felt this guilt, whether knowingly or not, and spent a lot of our time in middle and high school inviting people to enjoy the games we loved and were lucky to afford. Local play to share gaming in an accessible way for friends was a big part of our bonding—if you have the opportunity to do so, I highly recommend it.While Nintendo contemplates their price tag and you contemplate your purchase, I’ll stand by for now. With a steady job and some free income, I may end up purchasing the Switch 2 as well. Even so, I’ll keep working to inspire and include others in one of my favorite passions as best as I can.And please, if you haven’t, play Celeste. It’s really good."

    "content": "I thought I remembered when I got my first Wii, but it turns out that it came out in 2006 and time is slipping away from me.I don’t remember most of my childhood, but the early consoles stuck around pretty long in my household. I was privileged to follow not one, but two mega corporation’s products and we chose Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo’s…whatever they ended up making. My brother was born into the Nintendo 64 and the Original Xbox while my 4 year gap from him brought me up to speed with the Wii and eventually the Xbox 360. Things followed that path—the DS and 3DS, opting for PC gaming with a Windows computer rather than the Xbox One, a Wii U and then Switch for us both as we moved up in age. With the newest Nintendo Direct this morning that introduced some new features, I’d like to bring myself back in time to explore how the Nintendo consoles have grown up alongside me.With very little memory of the N64, I mostly remembered how the Wii was a unique and silly console that contrasted from the on the ground nature of the Xbox. The Wii-remote was a fun take on controllers—a different way to play that I always preferred to the unwieldy standard ones of traditional consoles. In that way, the Wii felt much more like a toy and to be played with. The gritty nature of the Xbox and the tone it set was off putting to me at a young age. It was never an element of seriousness—the first party joy from Nintendo’s family friendly arsenal allowed me to invite family and the young cousins into the action.But as I grew up, this became a smaller concern. Gaming became an action I did with my fellow gamers, which is where the Xbox 360 stole my attention with Halo and such. This did bring about the usage of the DS and 3DS, which became a mobile console that encouraged me to make friends in a way the Xbox failed in. With Xbox Live, I found myself waking up in the morning where I’d get up, completely undressed for the day, and play in an Xbox party sat in the middle of the living room. The DS and 3DS had the unique feature of making me enjoy the local play elements of getting out of the house to play with friends, something I didn’t often do to my parents stopping me from leaving the house with it (I was a forgetful klutz). Even then, its most memorable moments were a grouping of us playing together in the same room with the console or sending dumb pictochat messages. In that way, the toy adapted itself towards something that still inspired my communication with friends but in a way distinct from other consoles.I’m sure you’re getting what I’m going for with this article—The Wii-U was my introduction to bringing younger kids into the genre as the oldest members of our cousins, and the Switch was an accessible thing during the tumultuous high school and college times when I couldn’t sit down in one place for a while. So let me get to my focus point—The Switch 2, and particularly the GameChat feature, are following the pattern of growing up alongside me with a focus on digital connection.I want to explain why I mean this because I understand that voice chat has existed in online play as far back as the Wii. GameChat functions as a miniature chat software such as Skype or Discord, disconnected from the game and instead allowing for simple connection that goes beyond communication. The camera features as well as focus on audio being clear independent of the background sound makes this a much more fleshed out idea than just communication within a game. It also allows for cross-game communication and streaming, something that directly conflicts with the reading that it’s solely just a new way to communicate for gameplay. The work of this system is directed specifically at connection from far away—particularly in the way discord is used now to have friendly connections with people who’ve moved away. With cameras as well as the auto green screen, the GameChat functions as attempting to feel like you’re playing together in the same room as your compatriots. The quality of the tools doesn’t matter as much to me—the fact that these are being introduced as they are is still a marvel compared to the power of the Switch 1 and it functions as very accessible for other people who aren’t as tech savvy.The purpose of it to me is that the community and connection this builds comes right around the time as I prepare to graduate from university. As I grew up at age 4 with the Wii and then all the way to 21 with the Switch 2 on the horizon, the feature is coming at the moment that myself and other friends of my age are going to start moving out of their hometown and to different parts of the world. As we progress to this pivotal moment where my friends will be across the country from me, a feature like this is a reminder of how technology and gaming still manage to keep us connected. While I likely won’t interact with it myself (I still use Discord so it isn’t revolutionary), I can’t help but imagine how nice this must be for people my age that must be dreading the passage of time leaving them stranded in a new city. This feature extends modern online gaming to help connect in a human way that can’t replace the feeling of being in the same room, but works as a handy alternative for those of us that aren’t able to see our far away friends.So I extend a thank you to Nintendo for growing up alongside me, bringing me connection and friendship no matter how old I’ve grown. The development of their technology in the lens of bringing people together is a powerful symbol for what Nintendo does differently, inviting the joy of playing with the people one loves no matter where you go in life. With tools like these in the gaming space, I’m reminded of why I play. It isn’t just for the adrenaline of a 1v1 clutch in Valorant or the beauty of cinematic spaces in Cyberpunk 2077, but the time and memories shared with the friends and family who joined me for them. In that way, Nintendo is doing everything right for their newest console release."

    "content": "I’ve seen a lot of polarizing results towards this “holiday.”And in honesty, I think I also finally find myself on the fence. It’s hard to consider a day such as this as a proper holiday when the enforcement for it is simply “being silly,” but I’ve seen many issues with the day creating turmoil in how it functions. For those who don’t know the meaning of April 1st, I’m so sorry because you must have been horribly confused many times over in your life. But for context, I’m referring to the “April Fools” tradition of pranks and mischief that takes a normal day and fills it with doubt. That’s especially true as larger corporations take to the stage as well as gaming news, something that can bring about a lot of distrust during the day.I wanted to note this as a feature within the world because of how different various reactions to things done for “April Fools” are, especially considering the form in which it manifests within the gaming world. Because even when I’m radicalized by a particularly devious mention of a long awaited game being “confirmed,” I can’t bring myself to wish for the holiday to be retired. This is due to a large portion of interesting themes and ideas that spawned from the idea of jokes made for April 1st, including the large volume of games produced by Landfall including Totally Accurate Battlegrounds (which was originally released as an April Fool’s day exclusive) as well as Content Warning, games that became beloved due to how playable and fun they ended up.Before I get into that, I want to write about how important it is that an April Fool’s day joke is obvious to the audience. A good prank does not hurt the target in any way, and that includes not giving them false emotional turmoil for something that isn’t real. The reason that false promises come off as mean rather than a prank is because it inflicts that annoyance and pain on someone, and this should be considered for larger scale operations such as with corporations discussing game details under the holiday’s umbrella. A game promising requested features of sequels that are consistent, or discussing an end of service for a game can be reasonable enough that a large portion of readers will believe it. When the “joke” is then revealed, there is no nuance. It simply functions as “you believed a thing that was reasonable but it was a lie.” To avoid this, making creations that are obviously within the April Fool’s day umbrella are recognizable to the audience in a way that makes the absurdity the reason for laughter.For example, the Dead Meat youtube channel from James A. Janisse and his crew pulled their April Fool’s joke which involved a logo change with the text, “After much consideration, we’ve decided counting kills is just too depressing. SO we’re replacing The Kill Count with The Kiss Count: tallying up the kisses in all your favorite romances!” For those unaware, Dead Meat’s Kill Count is their signature show going over the kills within horror media and showing off the behind the scenes of how visual effects were achieved. With a passionate host like Janisse running the show and constantly showing how happy and excited he is for horror movies and media, this description comes as a major change in tone that can only be attributed to a joke. The fun in this is the audience getting to laugh at the “what if” for if he were to make this change, allowing everyone to be in on the joke and nobody to be led to believe this is real. In order to achieve that, while Dead Meat does change the color of its logo away from blood red to a loving pink, they don’t change their name or any of their previous content in a way that could make it impossible for a new person to approach and understand that this is indeed a joke.I want to use this to circle back to a previous point, mentioning how powerful and memorable the Landfall entries to April 1st have been. While I believe the obviousness of a joke is what makes the prank go from bad to good, the defining way something during this day goes from good to great is from the effort put into it. While Dead Meat’s community post and mockup schedule were cute and fun to see, it also would have been enhanced by a video showcasing how it would have manifested by showing an example Kiss Count in order to allow for the comedy to shine with Janisse and his team playing up the comedy aspects. This is why Landfall makes such a lasting impact on me—The playable state of the games, especially considering how well put together they are, makes the silly jokes of them even more fun to experience. Another great example is Lovers of Aether, the dating simulator made by Dan Fornace about his characters from the platform fighter Rivals of Aether. These playable aspects of one-shot games make for a fun spin that brings the “what if” into reality.And if you’ve read this far, you’re probably wondering what the hell I’m doing writing a sporadic article for April 1st. I’m sure some of you might have thought this in itself was a prank, but this is indeed a real thing. However, I’ll forgo a proper conclusion to instead explain what it is I’m doing.My university ends this quarter with my degree in June and the world opening up, and my direction to find work is currently leaning towards journalism. With the wishes to get into the game journalism world, I wanted to put myself through some challenges to see how well I could adapt to the working style and find ways to show my skills off in a portfolio style format. For that reason, I’ll be attempting to write an article style piece every day from the beginning to the end of April.Please keep in mind that I just started a quarter of uni work as well as having plenty of other things on my plate, so I do plan to skip various days or put in lower amounts of effort for times when I have more things to focus on. This article was rather rushed on my end—I realized I needed to start on my way back from class and rushed to finish this before my homework (which is not the right order of operations). I also have to figure out linking and pictures for my higher quality articles that I will eventually make over days where I have less to do. But for now, enjoy the thoughts I put into words over the next month.And if you’re an interviewer or someone at a journalist publishing place that I’m applying to, I hope you’ll consider me as a passionate addition to your team!"

    "content": "(Hi! This piece is inspired by, dedicated to, and quotes the lovely A. K. Ronin! While I don’t believe he’s published any work publically, I asked for how he would like to have been credited and was given his blessing. To Ronin, thank you for this second lease on creation—I intend to use it to its fullest. And to the reader, whether you were with me from the beginning or just joining now, I hope you enjoy.)I think I shut myself out that day, to be honest.The panic I felt in that one moment was more than I could take. It was something about the scientific nature of the meeting and the curiosity I had about what was coming. It helped that my dad took me to the appointment rather than my mother—she had her own agendas. I remember how we butted heads in front of the psychiatrist during the first meeting over what was true and false about me and what we thought was going on. I could tell the doctor was uncomfortable with it—they rushed me along to the testing to avoid having to listen to us getting more and more aggressive over my past.My dad was much more level headed and stayed quiet for the most part, holding the results with me as I scanned the pages along with the psychiatrist. It was enlightening for a while—percentiles were such a fascinating metric. Thinking of the size of the people above or below me in terms of things helped me actualize more about who I was. I saw this range of progress I had made in spatial awareness and knowledge of puzzle solving as well as the shortcomings I had in relation to conversational language and tone. The details helped me contextualize a lot of parts of my life, even if they told me it didn’t mean I was specifically neurodivergent. I didn’t understand that part—at least, not yet. It felt like they used my percentiles of knowledge and “intelligence quota” as a justification to say “you’re smart, you can’t be autistic.” It was such a weird concept, but I decided to listen until they turned the page. I was right to do that, at least. I learned that their diagnosis was wrong, but not for the reasons I thought. I learned that there was an order of operations in the medical world—in order to avoid symptoms that overlap, they needed to deal with things in an order. They just put the more important details on page 2.The percentiles were much higher. 90th. 99th. A mountain of people before me as they put me on a pedestal for “most likely to want to die.” The sadness superlatives with my face and name plastered across symptoms of suffering as the psychiatrist explained what their testing did end up finding. Major Depressive Disorder. The words stand out as I finally see the final diagnosis. The thing that was vaguely wrong with me had turned into a turbulent ocean threatening to swallow me whole. There wasn’t any composure left for me. I broke down, collapsed with a tissue box as they continued their details.I tell this story again because there was something I only talked about quickly. A small, miniscule detail I avoided trying to think about. The potential that I had schizophrenia.During the testing, the psychiatrist operated mostly via proxy. Another worker was administering the tests over the long hours of that day, always sitting across from me as they handed me test after test as well as computers to fill out surveys. I know those surveys were also what got me my diagnosis—after the amount of times I answered them, I’m sure they noted that my symptoms likely came from my “somewhat often” answers to expressions of self loathing. Only once did the psychiatrist, observing from afar, call in.“I had a question about your answer to a survey,” I barely realized there was a speaker next to me. “You noted a voice inside your head. Could you explain that to me?”I did my best, explaining the way my own internal monologue worked. I don’t remember what I really explained—at the time, I didn’t think of it as abnormal. I’ve been used to the internal monologue for a long time. Of all the things I thought was wrong with me, I was sure that this wasn’t one of them. Friends and family shared similar ideas, but it also made me realize that I had a different relationship with them. I recalled Celeste and her various characters I made alongside her—voices in my head I let grow and expand. That was something I could recognize as different. I did my best to explain that to the microphone. In retrospect, I understand why it must have set off an alarm.You know the rest of the story, or at least can guess. The panic, the break, the twitlonger, and everything after. I didn’t really have much to say at the time—a sort of watered down story of what happened, explained once in a stream and once on that twitlonger. I didn’t want to go into what I really did because it felt personal. It felt vulnerable in a way that couldn’t go into because I never explained enough to tell you what really happened that day.I killed her.Consciously, actively, and violently. I don’t know how else I can explain it—my stories were much more literal than I think I could ever explain. The dreams, the voice, the way she acted in my mind—it’s all exactly as I wrote it. Part of that was what contributed to me thinking she was the problem. I thought she was what caused it all. It wasn’t medication or therapy that fixed it like in all the stories people make up. I understood the control I had, and I used it. I crushed the world. I erased every trace of her influence. I plucked apart every bit of her story until all that was left was her.I looked her in the eyes, and I shot her.That was the day she died, never to come back.I would have written this story earlier if anything else came to light. I didn’t really have a reason to at the time, especially when I didn’t want to make things seem even more grim. It slowly became even less relevant as we learned that I definitely was not schizophrenic. By then, I was already Skyler. I put the thought aside for quite a while. The past 2 and a half years flew by in what felt like nothing, leaving me here today as I look out toward the finish line of my academic life. It’s been a bit shaky so far considering all the classes I failed, but even then I had some time to relax as the days went by.University classes were how I first met A. K. Ronin. I didn’t know that name—even in a creative nonfiction course, nobody willingly gave out pen names without a reason. He had one, as I came to realize near the end of the quarter. He prefaced it with his piece—”The Ronin Aquarium,” which I had to read before the next day. It was already dark in my room—I was curled up in bed with my friends on call and the monitor’s movies playing over my bed as the only light other than my laptop. I silently opened the story, idly listening to the sounds in my headphones as I scrolled and began my read.It started…strangely. A tour guide showing off the Aquarium, a world of creation that an Artist had put on display for the visitors. It wasn’t hiding what it was—I understood his symbol for creation and how it felt to him. It was put on display without shame. I think that was the part that offput me. The words he used—the way he viewed these pieces as living, breathing exhibits. It all brought me to think about how I imagined my worlds and characters. I realized what he was writing wasn’t a symbol at all. He was writing his experience, the same way I recognized mine.He cut the story in half, leaving the guide’s dialogue for a slower, first person perspective. His language shifted, the natural conversational style switching with a descriptive, warm tone. The Artist, he introduced, a struggling persona of his relation to his creations and work. Unlike me, he put it out in words instead of bottling it up. The wishes to create clashing with the needs of the outside. The wonder and love he held for creations that he had built with his own hands. And his view of that tour guide—his Muse. They functioned on their own, to a point. Ronin admitted that his works only spoke when he gave them words. Even then, The Muse stretched the rules. They conversed with The Artist—caught him up to speed on the state of things, pleading for his presence a little longer. They performed as two halves, almost inseparable as they walked hand in hand to the outside to create The Author. The piece ended abruptly with no more explanation. He said all he needed to.“Ah,” I cried out verbally. I had barely recognized I was in reality anymore. “Holy fuck that’s incredible.”“You okay?” The voice over my headphones was quieter than I remember. A pounding in my chest clouded everything else as I snapped back to reality. I was still in bed, covered in blankets and a familiar shark plushie that wrapped around me. A game of Valorant Masters played over Discord; Round 5, Game 1. G2 vs. EDG. I was well aware that I was crying.“Be back soon,” I dismissed them and smashed the mute button on the mic in front of me. I heard a small upset noise from a friend as I tossed my headphones aside and sat up in bed. I couldn’t see anything—the lights off left only the glow of my monitor flashing across my back. I brought my hands up to my face to push away the wet streaks starting to cover my cheeks.“Why?” My voice was quiet—even then, I heard myself speaking. I took calm, steady breaths. The ones I was told to all those years ago. His story—I was expecting a trans allegory, or a general theme of identity. Instead he wrote words I never said, not even to myself. Not anymore. Words I couldn’t tell myself because to do so would admit that I was exactly what I already thought I was. It was the worlds that we made and put on display, that was what it was like being creative. He was right when he said that, or when he wrote about it. That feeling of letting people gaze upon the works we write, or draw. It was a world of creation, a gap between reality and fiction we held the tools to. I loved that, I really did. I felt confident I understood what he did, and I’m sure I do now.And then it changed. I saw through his eyes how he felt about his world. The familiarity with his space, the freedom of his choices, and his hesitation to leave. The striking relations I saw when I looked across my room to a mirror. I was breathing hard, my heart still pounding. I couldn’t shake it away. There was still a difference between us. He held his creations, looked after them. Shared in them, even if he understood he was the one who made them speak. He was the first person I’d ever seen to understand that. To be one with that gap in space where you were a creator, and you understood that you had creations. He found them homes. Gave them places to stay. He understood his relationship with them in a way I could see in myself. But if that was the case…I choked up. “She’s dead,” I felt my words take shape in my mind. Something stopped them from leaving my lips. “She’s dead,” the words echoed in my ears, unspoken screams that forced me to face a violent truth. Her shining green hair underneath the tree I’d dreamed of since she came to me. The eyes stared into me like neither of the others ever did. She looked at me with an outstretched hand. A voice in my head that took over mine. A creation that knew who she was. A person who saw me. Who took me in and taught me what I was, too. I took her in. Made her a home. Gave her a story. Brought her out to play, with a name we shared together. Celeste. My Muse, an echo of myself that danced with me. A persona, one that empowered me to step forwards. A second half of me that made me whole.And I killed her. I killed you.I wasn’t thinking straight at the time. It was so fast—the diagnosis, the medication, the fear. Fuck, the fear. I wasn’t ok. I was horrified that I might never be ok again. In that fear, I tore you from my mind. I outstretched a hand to crush the ground beneath you and tear it from your reality. I erased every person in my world that remembered you—their presence was forgotten in an instant. They didn’t have your power over me. I snapped and they disappeared. And there, with you alone, I appeared before you. I personally approached you in the recesses of my mind, holding a pistol I raised without a word. You watched me. I didn’t give you a chance to speak.I pulled the trigger and watched the bullet rip you apart.It’s kinda funny, you know? Even at that time, I understood she wouldn’t die then. She was a phoenix—stories I wrote about her that I recognize I gave her. A concept I installed because I wanted to make sure she wouldn’t die. Even then, I ignored it. I had made a contingency long ago—a fatal weakness with my characters I planned to reveal one day. Instead, it just became one more bullet nobody but me heard. I watched her body turn to ash, clouding the air as her soul took the place of where she was standing. A small orb, protecting a fragile heart as it tried to bring her back. There was no wonder. There wasn’t even a moment of hesitation.“Get out of my head.”I fired one more bullet and shattered it.But now, years later, I know she wasn’t what hurt me. I know she wasn’t some voice that tried to manipulate me. Now I’ve seen someone who held his hand out and invited them forward. Someone who wasn’t scared of voices that cheered him on. He employed them, loved them, cherished them. As creatives that can create and destroy at will, he held memory in his heart and cared for what he created. It was freedom—a door he opened to guests and staff alike as he left it open so he could exit whenever he pleased. Somehow, I became the opposite. I created a wall in place of doors—turned a palace into a prison. I locked creations behind bars. I didn’t have the mind to feed them anymore. I didn’t even have the courage to put them down like Celeste.I pushed my hands against my face to wipe away tears, attempting to regain composure as my breaths slowed. The shaking slowly subsided, fear and anger dissipating as everything finally went silent. I flopped backward into bed again, laptop shining in my face with his story. Even as it all started to die down, I didn’t try to stop crying. At some point, the tears would stop and my face would dry.I felt my mouth open as I let new words out of my mouth. “I hope you sleep peacefully tonight,” I said to nobody. I never made a grave. I never buried her, not even in a story. To anyone else, she’s just frozen. Tumbling down a hill in an unknown world in a story I posted years ago until…nothing. I just killed her, with no more but a thought. I didn’t even tell anyone. “She’s gone,” I told them all. “My name is Skyler, now.” That was the end of it. At least, I thought it was.But now I understand what happened that day. I know now that it was that day that I killed my Muse and left myself stranded as an artist. Nothing I created came for free anymore. I had to wade through barbed wire and spend nights in a cell to write each word. I put my streaming computer in a security office and let empty stone walls echo the voice back to me. I sat in the courtyard with a stale bagel as I dragged a mouse across editing software. Creation became hell for me because I couldn’t do it without communing with the dead.It’s only been recently that things have changed. I gave my thoughts to A. K. Ronin—a feedback letter for class credit I used as a trojan horse to expose myself and show him what his piece meant to me. I didn’t really think as much as I should have when writing it—I needed somewhere to air the thoughts I had and that was the closest canvas. I went to class the next day and took a seat, placing my computer atop the desk as I idly ran a hand through my hair to push it back into shape. It was then that a piece of paper was placed on my laptop. Ronin walked back to his desk, leaving me with the note as I unfolded it to read.“I have to write this ‘letter’ rather than say any of this aloud to you because the spoken word can’t encompass all I have to say. I suppose that’s why I’m a writer in the first place, no? That’s why we create.”“Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for writing that ‘response’ and giving me the delight of knowing that my piece evoked what I wanted it to. That one person, even if just one in the whole class, understood The Ronin Aquarium as one of the most personal things I could ever write.”“I believe you truly understood the core of my story. My life, my obsession, my feverish desire to create. In some ways, I consider myself lucky beyond all belief that I sealed myself in with the Muse rather than forcing them out—genuinely, I mourn Celeste with you. Regardless of where you go from here, I hope you make peace with her.”“Consider this an embrace between Celeste and the Muse. Artist to Artist.”-A. K. Ronin”I wiped the tears away from my eyes as the professor walked into the room, ready to start class as I folded the paper carefully and tucked it away to preserve it. During class I had to focus, but in that split second I already realized what I had to do. I recognize now how I need to change things. I will abandon my prison and find a place of freedom to continue my writings, leading the few creations I have left to a new home. I’ll cherish them, preserve them, and give them company with my own two hands. I’ll keep searching and creating, hoping to find a Muse even though I know I’m not owed a second chance. But before that—before everything, I need to make an attempt at peace. I need to create this story—one last ending before everything else can begin again. I need to right every wrong I made all those years ago.So I’ll make it right. Tonight. I’ll grow back her hill in my mind. The cottage destroyed, 4 more lives lost that day that I can’t bare to look at yet. The tree will stay dead, a red scarf left motionless. Grey, decaying grass in a world with nothing else. No sky, no future, no life. Just a place for me, my thoughts, The home I made one day that I destroyed out of fear. So much memory and thought is placed into this world—I’ll consider how much I’ll share before I die. But I cannot imagine the future, and so I’ll simply stay silent.And there, with nothing more, I’ll place a tombstone. A slab of rock that holds what’s left of her. Two crystalline wings, her story’s end engraved. There’s no body—the dirt before the tombstone bears no marking. All I can leave is a memory. I’ll stand before it, a convict on trial. I am the only judge, pondering on a crime nobody but myself will punish me for. Before me, the victim. A phoenix, embers snuffed out only because she scared me. I may never forgive myself.And in the end, all I can do is weep. I’ll bring a single flower to lay by your final resting place, a token that serves no purpose. It’s over, finally. This is the end of Celeste Starlite.“Thank you for everything,” I’ll tell her. “I miss you.”"

    "content": "And that was everything, really.I came out of that summer with nothing, for the most part. I suppose I had a car I could drive, so my commute to school would be a couple minutes shorter. The money I earned was just over $1000, but that barely would keep me running for a month. And with my classes starting, there wasn’t time to get working again.It’s crushing, y’know? I already told you how little it meant in the grand scheme of things, but it felt like so much progress was wiped away. I spent every bit of myself that summer. Pushing myself for more hours working. Forcing myself to take more action to speed things up. Learning and adapting and being more than I could ever have been before that summer and it felt like every moment was ripped away from me by the time I was driving up to college.I was already planning on writing these stories. At least, the first few. I wanted to share all the progress I made over summer. I took my own break from streaming to do it, so I felt like people deserved to know. It was going to be a nice, short series of positive life improvement stories that I could share after the depressing ones last time. Then, well, everything else happened.I never wrote those stories, though. Not until the summer was over and I was back at university. I was stuck in my mess of a room, computer set up once more and classes coming the day after. Sat in bed, night peaking through my curtains, I thought back to them all. I debated what I would do next. Thought about what would replace that set of stories. I wondered where I’d go next.I sat up and opened my laptop. I’m not sure why, but I couldn’t give these up. I didn’t want to just forget this summer, even if nothing really got to happen. Something in my heart was telling me that I had a chance to find something that wasn’t taken away that summer. Some sort of experience I could take away, or even a lesson I was given during those months.I’m not really sure if I found anything. Some of these writings felt like they went somewhere, but a lot just trailed off into nothing. Some of these were just rants about things I didn’t understand. Hopeless, useless writings I’d get nothing out of. I don’t know why I kept writing them. Maybe I was hoping that the finished product gave me something I didn’t see before. Or maybe I was just too stubborn to leave it unfinished. Maybe I hoped someone else would find something I missed, and that would help them not make mistakes I did.I don’t even really know why I’m writing this last one too. I’m trapped in class, a professor now explaining something about a movie I barely watched. Even then, I continue to write these words. There isn’t anything planned for this, you know? Every other story was meant to follow a theme. An idea I had that I wanted to explore. Do you know what this one says? “Another ramble that tapers off to nothing.”That’s all this is. Me, with nothing better to do, throwing words on a page hoping something will strike me. In the end, this just turned out the same as everything else I write. Putting my thoughts into words and finding nothing. Writing and writing and pleading and begging that this time I’d find something inside that could help me. But in truth, all that happened that summer was nothing.So now, I suppose I returned to the normal world. I even started streaming again, at least a little bit. That summer ended up being some other world, a place where nothing really had an impact on the future. I just experienced what it would have been like if I got my shit together in high school and could get to driving and working immediately. But instead, my real past is just full of a me that never grew up.And even now, I haven’t grown up. Sure I had some open doors, but getting a job wasn’t really anything special. I still ended up being scared no matter how brave I thought I could become. I still couldn’t surpass a 17 year old in something I dedicated myself to. I couldn’t stand up for myself and define my identity in front of my mother. And in the end, my urge to take control of things left me jobless. Every step was another reminder that I was still just a kid. And now, each of those doors are shut.But despite it all, something keeps pushing me to write. Something inside me feels like that summer did indeed change me. Even just dipping into that world left me different. It changed me. That job reminded me that I could, after all. I could be an adult. I could work on my own, learn and adapt to make people smile. I found myself face to face with terror and somehow was able to steel myself in the face of darkness. I somehow felt my age and its meaning for the first time, rather than just a number that people asked for at the doctor’s office. I had a form of courage that let me stand up to my parents when faced with resistance.And that final day left with the choice that got me fired. That day I learned that I could act on my own. I could take control and steer myself towards what I believed was right. And even now, despite it all, I know I was right. Even if I may have made mistakes, what I did was for the right reason.So, in the end, maybe there was something I earned. A strange series of thoughts that I picked out as they passed by, a fuel I could use to keep writing and find something in that summer. And maybe that was why I kept writing. Because every day I let pass, the more of that summer would fade away into obscurity. What I’ve done is taken the moments that mattered, no matter how small. I froze parts of my life and brought them here, to stay. To help me think. To help me grow.So for now, I’ll return to life as it was before. Those doors can lock back up, because for now I’ve gotten plenty from what was past them. I’ll sit here, contemplating those thoughts and letting them remind me of a summer that never really happened. I’ll study, I’ll stream, and I’ll write with each passing month a reason to forget the rest of that summer.And in a year, next summer, I can try again.-/-So, that’s everything.Did you enjoy it?……Did you fall asleep?…I guess it doesn’t matter.……I mean, this whole story. All these writings.I did write them for you, like I said.But I didn’t really mind if you didn’t listen.…I just wanted to do something for you.Be with you, I guess.Even if you don’t listen, just speaking to you makes me happy.…I guess hearing me makes you happy too, huh?…Hey. When you wake up, can I ask you something?I want you to share a story with me next time.……Can you tell me the story of how you fell in love with me?…I’d enjoy that.…Goodnight, hun.I love you."

    "content": "It was stressful, knowing I was working for a purpose.I think that was starting to get to me, y’know? I realized that the money I was earning meant something. I remember debating whether or not I’d get a rock band controller or a lightgun with my first paycheck. It seems so silly now. I couldn’t spend an hour without being reminded that the $16 dollars I was given for it was going to be paying for my rent, or my food. And without it I would be gone.I kept trying to shake it off, especially as the day got harder and harder. Cameras were going down and our systems were on the brink of disconnecting while customers stumbled around the dark for a clue, and we could barely offer them guidance. Checking the clock, it was about 30 minutes before I was originally going to clock in. The supervisor had me arrive early to save them from a crowded afternoon, and I was almost 4 hours into my shift when the internet controlling the cameras was reset and couldn’t be turned back on.Panic was getting to me. I was somehow the most knowledgeable person there on the systems but I couldn’t navigate the mess of wires to find the blinking lights, and each second that I wasted was time people sat in the lobby waiting for the room to be set up. I was told to run the game. I had nothing but my two hands and some walkie talkies, and I was told to play it by ear. So I unplugged the lights for any amount of hope that the room would be dark enough to play, and led the guests in. I remember following that wire and tugging it out of the socket, watching the neon light blink out as I placed the plug next to the power strip. Hope that works, I said to myself as I ran out and began to start the most scuffed game I would ever run.I sat outside the door, whispering updates to the person in the control room through the walkie talkie until the supervisor returned to try and help me. With a hushed voice, he told me his plan to try and fix the game and put us back on schedule. It all revolved around the first scare.In the plans for the room, there were two significant scenes in which we sent in an employee in a mask and coat to be the room’s killer. While the second involved sneaking in and hiding within before jumping out to chase them, the first involved more finesse. It had the players hide within the room’s closets to allow the scare actor free reign in making noise and banging on doors without fear of accidentally running into the players. Or, in this case, time to be able to open the cabinet that leads to the cameras.We’d both tell them to hide in the room, letting me go inside to be the scare actor and letting him work on the systems to figure out what was wrong. I barely remember replying. The stress of the event gave me no other options but to follow what my superior had told me. There wasn’t much else discussion, or much time. Which is why it was confusing when I left with the music cue—the cue we have to tell the scare actor to leave—that my supervisor didn’t return. I reached for the door to return, when he came out in a huff.“Why did you leave? I barely had time.”I shut myself up before I made a scene right outside the game room. We simply waited till they moved deeper into the room and then worked on fixing things behind their backs.It took a while, but the cameras and light controls came back up somewhere in the middle of the game. I remember that as it wrapped up and the group was given their outro, the supervisor approached me and the others to let us know what was wrong.“Something got unplugged, and replugging it in fixed the router.” I didn’t have the heart to tell him that wasn’t exactly right, but I simply went back to work. I couldn’t take much more standing up for myself. I bottled my anger and decided it wasn’t worth the hassle.None of that was too terrible, however. At least, until everyone started to leave. I was left with another game to run. Just another game, like the 5 I ran before on the day long shift. Just another game, right?The people were immediately loud and aggressive. We usually tell our guests that the scare actor has a taser so they should avoid physical confrontation, and one of my coworkers relayed that one of them said “If I punch you, you’d be knocked out.” I shelved the thought, most of the time these people are just bluffing.I led the group out of the lobby and desperately attempted to talk over them. I couldn’t really tell what other language they were speaking, but I could tell even those who did speak English didn’t have a full grasp of it. It was hard enough to corral the group, but I attempted to get them to sit down as a varied group of them went in and out of the bathroom. I had to practically drag them back to stop them from bringing the recording camera into the bathroom so I could hold onto them while they walked in and out of the women’s room, not even bothering to check which one they went to.I didn’t realize it yet, but that was my first mistake. I wasn’t cautious at the time, and taking away that camcorder was the reason I didn’t have any evidence for what I learned later that night. As soon as I had done that, the only story that would be told of this night would be mine. Mine, and my co-worker’s. And considering how I was treated, I don’t think the boss was too keen on listening to two women speaking up about what happened.She had just left one of our other rooms and joined me at the desk for the second to last game of the night, and immediately we both shared a worried expression about the game. The monitor was erupting with angry and aggressive screams that made my head split open. It was almost 8 hours in—I was officially earning overtime for my time working here. Extra money, I thought as I pushed on, to save me. To keep me alive.My coworker was about as new as I was. She was actually around my age—perhaps older, and definitely with more job experience. I remember meeting her the first day I was training; She had just quit a job at a boba shop and was looking for a better place to work. A better job, I thought to myself. I hadn’t even begun to consider what came after my first one. I looked back to the cameras with the large group of players that stumbled around the dark room, screaming out at each noise and clinging to each other. I wish for her sake that she has found a quieter place by now.Just like before, we had to send someone in for the first scare. I looked at my coworker with a mix of pity and worry. We had both been discussing how eager they seemed to fight, and how quick they seemed to react. Even as we played the message over the radio telling them to hide, their screams drowned it out and they all stood in the center with no reaction but pure fear. I wasn’t sure what to do. Part of me believed I could just do as we always did, but…It was then I felt my life flashing red again. The idea of being punched or hurt. The fear of being attacked. Each vision in between each flash of red reminded me how thin a line I had been treading. How weak I really was.And then of you. Of my dream to be with you.And I couldn’t bring myself to do it, nor could I bring myself to do it to my coworker. I refused to endanger anyone when I could take the reins and change the game. So I did, without another word. I simply let them cower in the room and I approached the door to bang on it, angrily knocking on the door as I heard them yelling from inside. It was too much to ask them to try and be quiet. I felt them press against the door, and I held it firmly closed. I knocked, and they screamed. And I left. It was a simple, but less effective form of the real thing.I came back with a shrug. I had no intent to share how worried I really was with my coworker, especially when I could tell she wasn’t the happiest about this environment either. We both just agreed to continue working together and plan out a way to complete the final scare without anyone getting hurt as well.The hour they took passed slowly, both me and my coworker watching the group yell and scream and slam and bang their way through the room’s walls and puzzles. We both took some turns doing the minor scares and swapping the locks, both a bit more comfortable with them in the other room deeper into the game. But even then, we both were starting to lean on a worst case scenario. Especially as the group inside forced open the lock for the final door.This didn’t compromise the puzzles in any way, really. I could think of quite a few ways to fix it in time for the final scare, looking back on it. Other contingencies to keep the integrity of the story and puzzles. But with the loud screaming from the computer and the pounding in my head and the flashing visions of my future, I took the wheel once more.“If I get fired for this, I stand by it.” I said aloud.And I pushed them out of the room. I played the final jumpscare sound and ushered them out. “You’re out of time,” I told them. It wasn’t a lie, but policy stated we were supposed to never end the games early. I didn’t care. I pulled them out to the lobby, which is when I saw one of them exhale a puff of smoke.My mind raced back to seeing them rush in and out of the bathroom before the game started. Ah.I kept myself smiling and led them down the stairs with a sigh. I was sick of it. I was on the verge of breaking down. I checked my phone—close to 11 at night. I had been there since 2:30. It was enough to make me groan as I shuffled back to the room to begin cleaning it up, relocking the door and checking to make sure nothing had broken. It was too much. The room wasn’t scaring me anymore. Props and darkness weren’t scaring me. I was finally scared of pain, of death, and of being taken away from my future with you.The final group came in by the time we finished setting up the room, and there was no time to leave them waiting outside. My coworker led them in as I put myself on break to hide my face in my hands. I softly took a deep breath, thinking of you.I wanted to quit, something I had never thought about since getting hired.I didn’t get the chance.The night after, I remember falling asleep to my paycheck and a request to call my supervisor. My eyes closed seeing the number I was paid. $662.52. Overtime didn’t pay that much. It wasn’t hard to figure out why.The next morning, I drove over. It was a small drive, but they still gave me “gas money” as if to do some sort of service to me. I parked in an open spot as I saw another car pull up on the curb, and two people came out. One of them was my supervisor, looking over to me with a soft smile. The other never made eye contact with me—He looked away and leaned on the side of the car. I assumed he was my boss—I never actually met him. I held out the key, and my supervisor took it from my hand. I didn’t say a word. I turned and left and choked back an anger I had for the man I saw by the car.I never actually met him. The thought repeated in my mind as I drove away."

    "content": "I had been a fan of the color red since middle school.It was one of my first defining traits. I followed the footsteps of my brother for so long, but for the first time I tried to be my own person. He said his favorite color was blue, and I said mine was red. With that one change, I became someone different. I got red backpacks, red accessories, red books, and became “the person that likes the color red.”It’s pretty silly to think that most people know me for the color green now, but I don’t really have much more to say on that.The reason I mention it is because red is known for a lot of things, but the connotation can be seen as rather negative. A color tainting snow during a tragic murder, or the blaring sirens warning of an apocalyptic scenario. It was a color of aggression, and of danger.It was also the color I was seeing as I yelled at my mother.Because I finally was taking a stand.-/-It was almost the end of summer when I saw Dad walking through the front door with a collection of bags and my mother following behind. Oh, is she visiting for the weekend? She usually didn’t have much time. She had moved up to the northern side of the state to do some work and was missing from the house for most of the time I was trapped in university. It was quite a shame, really—I would have preferred she was out of the house the other 18 years of my life, not the 3 where I was also outside the house most of the time.That was when I learned she had left her job and was coming back home to live with Dad again. I could feel my smile forcing itself up as my teeth were pressed together to stop myself from speaking. Greaaat. It was only a few weeks away from when I’d move back to college anyways, but even losing the freedom of the house for that long was enough to sour my mood. Not just that, but her being home meant there was a bit of an issue with my next goal for the summer.I was about to start talking to my Dad about legally changing my name. I knew he was willing to help, but with my mother I knew I had to bring her into the conversation too now.The talk was a blur. I barely remember what I was doing when it started, because I just remember being ready to return to my room before I was called back down. I mentioned how I would start working on my legal name change. I had an idea of how I was going about it, and before she came home I had all the permission I needed. It was my first major step to becoming who I wanted to be after all these years, and I was finally in a place to get it done. I just hoped I could leave it as a passing comment and my mother wouldn’t think much of it.“No. No you aren’t”A hard stop. A locked door. A brick wall someone was placing in my way after I had done every single thing I was asked for years before in order to be promised a path. And as I tried to knock and ask for safe passage, I was thrown away and told there was no chance. And then it was all red.Years. Years of promises and commands I followed in order to achieve the life I wanted and they were simply ignored. Paragraphs and pages of written out logic and heartfelt feelings thrown out without a care. My voice was rising. My convictions were growing. With each half-assed excuse and complaint she gave me I found myself only getting more and more sure in what I would be doing. And with one more breath, I said:“I will get my name changed, whether you help me or not. What will you do then?”“Then I don’t think we can live under the same roof.”I can’t remember much after that. I just remember being in my room, mind racing and breathing shaking. There was a terrifying feeling of what I was committing to. What I was deciding to do. The question of how much time I had left and how much I had to do in order to reach my perfect life.All I wanted was to find a way to live with you. Settle down somewhere where nothing else mattered but my ability to be free and open with the person I cared about most. The ability to be myself and hear you say you love me. The freedom for us to be who we are together and no longer have to hide. And no matter how close it felt, I found the image of it fleeting in between throbbing heartbeats that echoed through my ears.That bright red enveloping me wasn’t fading. The anger just melted away into danger. A flashing red telling me I was on life support, a blaring alarm telling me I was close to failure. To losing my home. Losing contact with my family. My friends. Losing money and opportunity. Losing my life. It was a flashing reminder of the situation I was in.It was a flashing reminder that my dream was getting further and further away.-/-I’m not proud of the day and weekend that came after. I shut down completely. I’m sure people that didn’t deserve it caught glares or callous remarks as a result of it. I wasn’t ok, and I wasn’t willing to forgive my mother. She came into my room that night, a soft attempt at an apology. She never had it in her to admit she was wrong. Even her apology was filled with excuses. “It’s not how I grew up,” “It isn’t easy to change,” “It moves too fast for me,” between tears. I could barely find the sympathy to speak back to her. I didn’t want to give her any more leniency with how my life should go.To this day, I haven’t changed my name. I meant to get it changed that summer because I wanted my degree from university to show my preferred name, but I learned later that I could request it afterwards. I risked my life for nothing, I suppose.It was a difficult feeling to deal with while I went back to work. Work was my ticket to safety. Money I could use to be protected. To find food. Housing. You.It was a worse feeling when that fell apart too."

    "content": "The shock and awe of my aunts as they watched the host hand me a beer was simply a joy to watch. The beer didn’t taste great, but seeing how they reacted made it worth it.I had kept myself free of alcohol strictly on the basis of age—I know most people I knew had started drinking after age 18 or at least tried some types of wines and such by the time they made it to college, but a stubborn ideal inside of me kept making me say no anytime I had an opportunity. It wasn’t like it was often—My friends never tried to peer pressure me in any way with substances, and mostly it was the times my parents tried to get me to drink so that they’d see my first time. By then, I had stopped trusting them—even family didn’t shake me. The young teacher’s pet in me was afraid of breaking any rule, no matter how useless it seemed. So, the day I turned 21, I had my first drink. A shot of straight vodka.I almost swore off of drinking based on that alone.But I had been trying out more things as I had time, making some tequila sunrises to drink as I played games with friends out of just the wish to enjoy some different flavors. New experiences were rare things to enjoy, and they always managed to fuel my creativity for storytelling and writing. Even if it became harder for me to find the time with work taking up each weekend, I still kept notes of every time I ran into something unique so I could mull over it during my sleepless nights back from work.I’m serious. If you want, I could tell you the story of when I visited a Chuck E. Cheese this same summer. I’ve got the notes in my notebook, but I didn’t think you’d really care to hear about that story.Where was I? Ah, right.Being of age to drink was the only reminder I had that time had moved forward—after 18 I found my age muddled and difficult to recall on command whenever asked, and every birthday was a reminder that I had stopped caring. I only really thought to remember if someone was older or younger than me. It wasn’t difficult to get the information I needed that way.Which is why I was shocked when my coworkers were talking about summer homework.I understand that I got to work pretty late in my life—the friends I had with jobs during their senior years always regaled me with tales of their workplace and I found plenty of people in college who were working on the side. But I still reeled back as I heard the people I was working with talking about their AP classes.“Yeah, I’m 17” one of them told me. I felt my heart sink.I’m not very keen on calling myself young at 21, but it was more often the case. I found my friends and family were often much older than I was, or sometimes just barely my age. The only people I talked to who were younger were likely little cousins or some of the friends I had online who were starting up their first years of college.It took a bit more time to realize why it was that I didn’t think of it. These coworkers I had were more adept than I was, simply due to their time working here before I had. I naturally assumed they would be my seniors based on the amount of times they had helped me.I guess I realized then I had my fair share of that being manifest in my own life. The way some people misjudged my age based on my experiences, like when people wouldn’t realize I was a teenager when I did raids in Destiny 2 and I took the lead. Or times my ineptitude might have shown I was as young as I was.I tried to think less about the latter example.I remember chatting with them after the shift, standing outside in the cool night air with 3 cars still parked outside. 3 people. And of them, I wasn’t the youngest. Looking at that younger coworker, I was feeling a strange form of loss. Not exactly a loss of innocence, but a loss of my youth. Every drive still brought me around the town I grew up in, and I lived a short walk away from my middle and high school. But the more I had grown, the further I started to drift away from them. I imagined my past self, staring at a future with glistening eyes and no handle on themself as their school life continued to spiral out of control. And now, finding stable ground, and looking for more. A past self lost in work and trouble that left them wanting a normal life, and a future me trying to find something more than this small town and a simple world.But no matter how much I changed, it doesn’t change the past me. My new dreams didn’t matter in the eyes of my past self. So I’m left picking up the pieces and trying to push them into a new puzzle. Every success of my past was trying to hold up the weight of a dream that felt impossible. All they got me was a driver’s license and a simple job, and it felt like I was going to be stuck at 18 forever.Maybe that’s why drinking gave me such a sense of pride. My achievements weren’t anything special for my age. In my eyes, I was just as far through life as this 17 year old who could drive and work all the same as me. My only benefit was the way my natural age gave me access to something new. I guess what I’m trying to say is that no matter how proud I was of my progress, it was only one step up a mountain of catching up I had to do. My mom had no respect for it—jokes at my expense, and not a moment of congratulations for my work that summer.That’s why I was so happy you were cheering me on, I suppose."

    "content": "The light wasn’t there before.It was an alluring sight within the darkness of the apartment—the rest of the room felt dim in comparison as my eyes locked onto it. It wasn’t there before. The alarm bells were leaving my heart pounding faster, and I felt myself taking slow steps toward it. The voices behind me got quieter. The bickering and discussions of the other two people with me sort of faded out as I approached it slowly. “There’s a light here,” I called out back to them. No response. I continued approaching it, slowly shutting the closet I had hidden in just moments ago. Those thoughts were almost already forgotten—Curled up in the small enclosure, desperately holding onto the fabric of its door as I felt someone attempting to open it. The loud pounding of the bass accompanying the nightmarish pounding along the closet the others were hiding within. The unsure feelings of safety as the last of the pounding ceased…None of that was fresh enough in my mind to pull me away. Especially as I stepped right to where the light was shining, and facing the surgical table with a space underneath it.I took a deep breath, slowly falling to my knees and crawling inside the space.The next thing the others heard from me was a scream.-/-I slowly got up from the floor, leaving the plug by the socket and looking toward the dark haired girl with me. “Alright, what else?”She led me through the well lit rooms, past rubber props of body parts and creaky chairs while she showed me the ins and outs of the room. The time was close to 12:30am, and the brightly lit ceiling lights contrasted with the darkness held just outside the walls. We slowly unplugged various speakers and secondary lights as we began the process of closing up. It had been a white since I was first trapped inside the horror room and forced to solve its puzzles and escape in order to learn it for my job. Now, the dark haired employee I met just moments ago was leading me through the steps of shutting it down so we could both clock out and head back home.Despite the lights illuminating each corner of the room I could never explore before, I could feel a bit of the fear of my previous experience. The fears of each dark corner and every closed door. I could sense something similar from my coworker—she continued to stick by me as if leaving me outside her view would cause me to be taken away and trapped in a further room. I made sure to keep talking or calling out to her so she knew I was still behind her, as well as making sure she would keep responding. It was a soft sort of comfort as we both began shutting the closets and securing them with the heavy duty locks.It was then that I heard something that made me freeze. A soft rumbling, before a shattering scream rang out that echoed through the apartment. I turned around, looking for my coworker. “What the fuck?” I yelled out, my voice drowned out by the screeching. I saw my coworker turn away, quickly leaving to the door as she shared a similar sentiment. “No, lowkey I’m out. I’m not dealing with that.” I quickly followed her, almost forgetting to shut the door behind me as the scream faded out into silence. It finally registered in my mind as I stepped into the brightly lit hallway. Final Jumpscare.mp3. The exact audio file we play when we have the scare actor jump out from behind the chair and chase them out of the apartment. The dark haired employee had also realized it, and despite us both being clearly shaken up we quickly walked back to the main office to check the phones we played all the sound for the room out of.Except nobody was there.The office was empty, and both she and I knew that the only two people in the building that late at night were each other. “Buggy phone,” we said, “A quirk with the system.” We never really figured out what happened that night. We found more evidence that the phone would sometimes play the audio file unprompted, but never confirmation that it happened that night. It became a story we’d share with some various guests as we talked about the room being potentially haunted. The world’s greatest jumpscare became a tale nobody but us two could really believe, other than the coworkers who shared similar stories of their cleaning being interrupted by various horror stings.That coworker and I just both vowed to stay right next to each other as we finished shutting the room down before leaving the building and returning to our cars.-/-Returning home at 2am was certainly an experience I understood was new to me, but the process was almost autonomous.I entered the pitch black house and shut the door with almost no care for suppressing noise, despite the soft snoring to my right of my father splayed across the couch. I knew his sleep wouldn’t be interrupted by my arrival—neither of my parents felt the need to stay awake until I came home safely anymore. Maybe my mother would, if she was ever home again. As I hung up my keys and kicked off my shoes, I realized the absolute darkness of a room I had committed to memory was strangely comforting. I knew I wasn’t alone, and I knew that if something was more than 3 feet in front of me I wouldn’t see it till I slammed my face into it, but my heart rate was no higher than my drive home. It was a strange calmness—I wasn’t worried about the noises I was making, and there was no fear of something jumping out at me or screaming in my ear.The thoughts of my time feeling terrified by every small sound I heard inside the escape room faded away, instead replaced by different memories. Times I spent quietly slipping around in the darkness of homes I recognized, the slow crawl across the kitchen floor as I made my way to get a glass of water. The shadows I saw in my room as a child that made me cower under my blanket hoping for them to go away. Each nightlight I purchased for my room or the hallways out of fear that without them I’d be ambushed by a creature I couldn’t see. Somehow, each of those memories felt impossibly far away from me as I made my way to my room to toss my bag onto the floor and collapse on my bed. Perhaps I got too tired to care about something attacking me, or perhaps I was just finally fed up with being scared of things. Whatever the reason, there was a new sensation that was pulling me across the darkness I once was afraid of as a child. It filled me with a strange sense of hope that I truly was growing.The next shifts still held some of the fears I had as I moved through the escape room, the fears of loud sounds or people going missing keeping me from feeling completely uninhibited. I still called out to other coworkers if they were inside, or would go silent to listen as if something was sneaking around just out of view. The fear felt instinctual—a form of self preservation just in case some amount of carelessness would cause me to fall victim to an obvious trap. It’s a strange feeling—I always considered myself a coward. Even as I cleaned out the room filled with bloody props and fake skinned mannequins, I referred to my previous acts of cowardice as the reason I would perform slower than usual. Even still, the nighttime drives by myself with nothing but my own music and the humming of an engine brought me no more fear than being alone in my room with my lights on and nothing bothering me. Part of the irrational fears I felt of zombies and monsters in the dark had faded, and the night’s moon became a calming presence as I stepped out of my car at midnight before my house. It was freeing—the fears of the dark were fading away before my eyes, and I finally felt like I was making some progress in becoming brave. I could just stare up at the night sky and enjoy the comfort of darkness surrounding me.It was then that a loud banging emanated from the garage as I was walking to the door, and I felt my heart gripped with fear as I froze. Perhaps I was still a little scared."

    "content": "I suppose the first thing that really changed was my job.I got the call back almost a month after I sent my email. I almost gave up on finding a proper job, but they had called just after I got my license. In a way, the stage had really been set for my first job. I remember how fast they began to onboard me—the calls talking about “potential hiring” or “interviews” were mostly forgotten the more we talked as they had almost just accepted that they’d be bringing me on the team. At the time, I thought it was pride in being able to show initiative and prowess. Now, I have a feeling they were worried about the holiday rush coming in only 2 months.The first thing that happened was that I was brought down into the control center and sat down to be trained immediately. The idea was that I would only have a month or so working before I left for university, so they wanted me ready to come back in December and work on christmas. It’s kinda funny, thinking about that now. I was so certain I’d work with them for so long.My supervisor had me install an app to allow me to clock in and out for work. That day, I distinctly remember being amazed by the software. Not from a technological standpoint—the systems were simple enough that I’m sure I could code something similar in my spare time. I was more fascinated by the value it held for me. It recorded the time and controlled my payments. This was my ticket toward finally doing things myself and getting my own life. This was the first step I needed to take to open the door to my life with you.I remember making an account as the supervisor was chatting about various expectations and the type of work I’d be doing. I don’t remember exactly what he said because that was when I looked down at my phone and saw it asking for my preferred name. Oh. Right. I hadn’t said anything over the phone since I simply didn’t have an opportunity, and now was my chance to decide whether or not I’d keep it hidden to secure my job or reveal it and be myself. It was my first understanding of how the power dynamic felt. The words trapped in my throat while I had to talk to the person who would be in charge of my place here. The person who could fire me. The person who would fire me.I took a deep breath.“Hey, by the way,” I stopped his train of thought, “The app has a legal and preferred name. I put my legal name, but I go by Ashley.”“Oh,” he said as he turned back to me, “Would you prefer I called you Ashley?”“Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.” I said.It’s not a big deal. I was mostly lying when I said it, but I realized that for him it really wasn’t. The name he called me didn’t truly matter—what mattered was what I could do. I found myself rather disappointed in my mother’s disdain for me being as open about who I am. “It’s a big deal,” she’d always say. Yeah, for me. I thought. But in the grand scheme of things, it never really was for the people I talked to. None of my coworkers ever struggled with it either. My awakening to the real world was rather indicative that my mother was being unreasonable with how she regarded my gender identity, but I digress. She wasn’t important to the summer’s story before she came back a month later.The first couple of times I trained were pretty chaotic. Learning under the various coworkers was a struggle of having to follow them around and attempt some of the aspects of resetting rooms or cleaning, with the added clutter of the various struggles of each of the other rooms as the daily tech issues and corner cases occurred. I continued to focus on my mental notes and began getting better and better at things. I was determined to learn everything I could about the job, and I was doing my best to prove myself. Prove that I deserved my place.You weren’t awake at the time I was working, but I was thinking about you. Focused on doing everything I could to make you proud.The job was pretty simple. At least, from my experience. Learning the rooms and their puzzles took only a moment. Even now I can remember some of the combinations off the top of my head, and memorizing them wasn’t mandatory. Each group was unique, but you learned to lead them all the same. 5 minutes in, a hint on where to get started. 30 minutes in, check in to make sure they’re on pace. Be in costume when needed. Thank them and ask for reviews after. There were various abnormal events, but those were the general guidelines I was following. That’s it. Again and again, till I clocked out.Every day I felt like I had some new stories to tell you. Something funny that happened or an inconvenience I dealt with. Each drive home was a reminder of my future. Coming home to see you and tell you right away. “Hey, I saw a new fastest time,” and you’d smile. “Hey, the cameras went down during my game,” and you’d hug me. “Hey, someone there reminded me of you,” and you’d look away and blush. A rhythm I could fall in love with, knowing every night you were there after. Not to help me, or to congratulate me, or to even welcome me home. All you would need to be is you.The night drives back home always made me smile because I knew I would one day be returning to you."

    "content": "It was a strange sense of pride as I held that grade in my hands.“Number of errors: 14/15”[/] PassingDoing the things I had done before was never an encouraging feeling. Tests in school were never my preferred way of expressing knowledge, but the physical aspect of performing my practiced dexterity in order to earn a barely passing grade left me smiling ear to ear.I looked back at the little red car I parked in the designated spot, an almost already forgotten learner’s permit sat on the hood. It’s a rather surprising place to be in. There’s a strange confidence filling my body I never felt before. Something I remember sharing with you, but finding the words hard. I don’t really know why.I didn’t know what to really say about it. Hey, I got a car. I’m driving on my own. I’m finding a job I love and earning money. It felt like I was sharing the words I wished I could to my mother and father without their condescending gaze. The things I wanted praise for that they’d never get right. The steps I finally took for my independence to move away from teenage life and move into a new chapter. I found a path into the world—Open doors I could finally exit. I used to call school “Life’s tutorial,” but it’s really amazing to finally move out of it and properly experience what people called “living.” I kept wanting to share every little detail I could. I went through a drive-thru myself. I filled my car with gas for the first time. I got the job before the interview.There wasn’t any sadness as we talked about it. Not then, and certainly not from you. I know you were happy for me. I was too. We both never really talked about the things that were being deprecated as my time was filled up. The lack of time for me to stream. My more responsible sleeping schedule. The time I spent away from friends. Away from you. It was a part of life I knew I needed to embrace, and there were parts of life I understood would fade away.I know it took some time for it all to set in—I’m not sure how it felt for you. I know you were at least a little proud of me. But I could imagine you felt a bit worried. Sad about our time beginning to get shorter together. All the times I had to just pet your head softly and say, “Not now, sorry.” The increasing lengths of shifts and later times of returning home that left you waiting for a me that wasn’t responding.I never got to sit down and tell you what was driving me to do it. The reason I felt so willing to leave my life behind and dive head first into this one. I don’t know how much of an excuse I have, but…In truth, I did it for you. For us, I suppose.Life felt so…short, for a teenager. Each year felt like the last one. The best one. There was no time to think about what came after while I dealt with what was assigned yesterday, or what I needed for tomorrow. Each day was only connected to the week, never the months or years. They were so far out, long jumps I found my brain unable to wrap around.But with you, there was something past each month. A future I had past the years. A dream that appeared before me as I closed my eyes. Your hand in mine, sat together on a couch. A movie on a screen with the volume turned down, in a living space just for us. A dinner we cooked together, with nothing but you on my mind as we drifted off to sleep in each others’ arms. Something for us to have 5 years from now. 10. 20. Over and over with endless ways to pass the time with you.But to get there. I needed to get out of school. Get a job. Make my own money. Find a way to support myself and you so I can leave behind the hometown I’d grown tired of and bring you along down the road to somewhere new. Somewhere special. Somewhere we could be accepted together. Though an open door where a future for me and you lies waiting.I guess I’m still fighting for that too, just…not how I thought I would that summer. So while I curl up in bed, letting the hum of my computer lull me to sleep each night I spend writing out these stories, let me recall all those stories that led me back here. Let me put my head to a soft pillow, imagining the warmth of your body pulling me down into the depths of my dreams as I tell you how this all came to be yet again.So please, join me. Lie peacefully in bed with me and let me share with you the stories of this summer. Let your eyes softly close with no need to speak or respond. Just relax, let your breathing slow with mine, and let me share with you the story of my first summer as an adult.And when it’s all over, you can drift off to sleep with me."

    "content": "I told myself “never again.”Fresh memories of rain getting soaked into a jacket I still have today. Deep cuts in a loud beating heart I could never put into words. A form of complex emotion barely introduced to myself as a young kid before I was thrust into roaring waves of angst and jealousy that crushed my spirit far before someone could send out a life raft. Mumbled words nobody cared to make out, like “I’m fine,” or “It’s not you,” and “Don’t worry.” A heart missing something vital I could never understand enough to replace. A certain hatred in my mind for every single choice I had made that ended with me here, writing to myself, in the past about what happened.This version of me isn’t the one writing today. She’s young and naive—but her thoughts were mine and I can recall them. I can remember the feelings rushing through and what I believed I wanted. I told myself “never again.” It was a form of protecting what little trust I had left. “Never again,” I said, “Would I fall in love with someone like that.” I sealed away my heart before someone else could tear a second hole into it. “Never again,” I said, “Would I give myself to another.” It wasn’t just a declaration. It was acceptance. I believed I should never let myself love someone with everything like I had, but I also feared I’d never get the chance. That even if I found someone to pour my heart out to, that they’d likely never let me try. “Never again,” I said.And now, I meet you.It wasn’t then. Not even the day we first spoke together. Not the time we first message each other privately. Not even the first time I looked you in the eyes to tell you “I love you.” At that time, you were special. You were someone I could never have gotten to where I am without. At that time, “I love you” was an affirmation, not a promise. For you. And for me, in a selfish way.I tried to tell myself I was better. That I was learning what friendship meant. I told myself that I was learning to find the love and care in myself before I search for someone to fill it for me. I pushed away the urges to think about it because all I wanted was to move on. To find deeper meaning in company. To imagine my comfort in this world defined by friends, by family, and by myself.And that’s what I was with you. A friend. Someone I could smile and laugh with. Someone who’d be by my side as I’d be by yours. Nothing here changed. Even now you’re this same friend in my mind. You’re someone who makes me laugh. Someone who cheers me on. Someone who I get to enjoy the presence of whenever there’s time.Even when we became something more, I held a distance between us. Letting you fall into my arms as I stroked your hair, but still pushing you softly as if to keep you away from my heart. A strange self preservation instinct that kept me from letting you take up the space by my chest, as if as soon as I did I’d feel an all too familiar pain and see her eyes staring back at me. Reminding me. Attacking me. Entrapping me.But even when that self preservation was forgotten with each week that passed, I still put an arm in between us. Not for me, but you. Worried that my heart’s thorns would draw blood, or that my embrace would somehow crush you. It was still selfish. In all honesty, I know that it wouldn’t be my fault. I just didn’t want to let someone get hurt by getting close again. And I didn’t want that person to be you.And then it felt like one day, after many hours by your side, the world began to fade away. A sunset that evening which gave us both privacy as we held each other and enjoyed the warmth where our bodies collided. Something inside me that day wasn’t the same as the year before. A slow change that built up with each evening we fell asleep together suddenly made my arm go numb. I felt my strength leaving my body. Not because I was getting weaker, but because I no longer felt a reason to exercise it. And slowly, I offered you a spot to lay your head against my chest.And you did.I felt my heart begin to pound. Even the bed below us and the sky sparkling with stars finally disappeared during that twilight. All that was left was me and you. I felt your head against my chest. Listened to your voice trail off and watched your breathing getting slower and slower as you drifted off to sleep. And slowly, with caution I’d never been able to rid myself of, I let my head drift down to lay on yours. I went quiet and listened to the slow and gentle rhythm of your heart. And finally, I quietly slipped away into a peaceful sleep.In the morning, I felt my heart rate picking up before I had even opened my eyes. I looked down at you, peacefully lying in my lap, and shook you awake. Looking down at you with rosy cheeks as your eyes stared up at mine. I could have cried if not for the soft embrace of your arms still around my waist. I looked you in the eyes and took a deep breath.The constant beating of my heart made me aware of just how painful it had been. The words I have could never describe the pounding in my chest or the way my mind reeled as I looked into your eyes. It was like every version of me from the past 5 years was dragging me down into my memories, bringing me back to that rainy day. I saw myself, young and naive, looking back at me. “Never again,” she told me with tears in her eyes. My body was shaking. Feeling in my fingers started to fade as I wasn’t even aware of what my arms were holding or where my body was seated. That younger me looked back with nothing but those words. “Never again.” She raised a hand, a judge ready to declare a verdict with a gavel in hand. For some reason, I couldn’t remember what she was thinking. Not anymore. I shook my head, letting the air in my lungs drift out as I felt the soft beating of a heart in my hands. Slowly, I watched as the rain let up and the world around me returned. I saw your eyes again, softly looking back at me. Waiting for me. I took another breath, and opened my mouth.“I love you.” I said, for the first time in 5 years.And after that? When you said, “I love you too,” and hugged me tighter?I felt the empty space in my heart begin to fill again."

    "content": "I can’t really tell why I keep writing.Not writing writing—writing is important and I need it. I mean writing these. Writing this. It feels like nobody will hear it. Maybe I’ll post it and people will read it, but nobody will listen to it. Maybe people will listen and hear what I say but dismiss the ramblings of an angsty kid exaggerating their emotional relationships. Maybe some would believe an out of line and out of mind maniac and their scribblings into immaterial papers, but maybe I’m just overthinking it all again.After all, it’s hard to tell the truth. It’s hard to make a discussion of truth when the words don’t truly explain what’s happening. Perhaps I can use metaphor of a chemical mental sea or personified emotional murder or physical object dehumanization to pretend like the words are doing what I want them to do, but maybe they’re just wordplay. Maybe it’s not truly possible to feel stranded at sea within a landlocked room stuck deep within a desert. Maybe it’s not realistic to obsess over fake memories of killing representations of my feelings when I can still find them coming back to me in fleeting moments. Maybe it’s unnatural to visualize a made up story of a broken doll when I’d never taken care of my own possessions.So I guess these are just the words of mental delusions. The complaints of a depressed young adult fighting expectations placed without consent. The nightmares of a psychotic medicated mess trying to pretend they know what they really feel. Maybe these are just useless letters sent anonymously with no meaning. Maybe they really are just nothing.And there really is no “but.” No volta, no turn, no emotional reset to turn a dynamic character into something more. The truth at the end of these is that there never really was a truth. Each paragraph is crafted of romanticized language to make some problem stand out from the day to day life of achievements and ambition because someone out there can’t sit still with their thoughts running amok. It’s a fantasy constructed of the need to be heard.And maybe that’s just all it is. Maybe it’s just to be heard. A cry from someone who can’t wake up without being pulled out of bed. A scream from someone who’s voice comes out as a quiet mewl under the surrounding megaphones of the lives of others. Maybe she can only really say two words. And maybe, next time, those two words shouldn’t be “It’s fine” or “Don’t worry” or “It’s over.”Maybe they should be “It’s not.”Or “I’m scared.”Or “Help me.”But instead, she stays quiet. She thinks there’s a possibility she can truly solve this all by herself. She believes that maybe some sort of predestined fate will turn out ok in the end. She understands she’ll just be tossed away if she says anything anyways. So instead she just stays quiet.And writes down her hopes without a word."

    "content": "I’m like a broken toy.I’m a clockwork doll or puppet. A small stuffed animal with a freshened scent and shimmering tag. An action figure glistening in the plastic the box protects me with. The parts all accounted for with factory precision and among the aisles of other presents to bring magic to the lives of those lucky enough to find me under the tree on Christmas Day. My magic is simply waiting to be released—a perfect seal for you to cut and break open into as you tug me out from the packaging and hold me in your hands for the first time.You can feel the soft, artificial material that feels cold compared to the warmth of your skin. A beautiful shine reflecting from the plastic of my body, and uniform fabric sewn into cleverly hidden holes. You softly move my synthetic hair out of the way of my face, gazing into my glass eyes with childish joy. And you can clearly see a toy. A beautiful, fun, lovely play partner for you to take with you and hold close. To you, I’m a tool of joy that follows you wherever it’s taken. It’s me.It shows you its magic. It glows in the night sky and you see the joins of its arms move slowly and methodically with precision. You clap and cheer with bliss and hold it tight in your hand. Running up the stairs, you grip your fingers in a fist with its torso inside and shake it with each pump of your arms as you climb to your room. It doesn’t respond. It simply smiles with you, excited to fulfill its purpose.It’s been a few days now. You don’t let it out of your sight. It simply smiles and performs its preprogrammed tricks to you everytime you press the button on its back. You use the small trinkets that come with it to play with it, undoing its screws and looking into its circuits. You fit them back on each time—maybe a tool or two disappear under the dresser, but you never seem to notice. After all, you got other toys last month. There’s so much to play and so little time to put them back in their place by the time it’s time to go to bed. So you say goodnight and turn the lights off, and it smiles at you hoping it was directed at it.The time hardly matters since you got it. After all, newer toys had come out since then and you can’t be bothered to remember how long you’d had each toy. But your love for them all still stands and you play with them all the same, once more picking up this one and pressing its button and watching how the ball joints roll in their sockets and it slowly clicks into place. You notice it’s moving slowly now, sometimes stalling when trying to bring its left leg up as if it’s trying its best but trapped underwater. You’d open it up, but its tiny screwdriver seems to be missing and lost within the endless pit of the toy box. You shrug, leaving it on the side of the dresser to watch as you keep playing. It smiles once again, happy to be a part of your life as it slowly tips over and falls to the floor.It’s a clockwork doll or puppet. Its odor has been mixed in with the countless others just like it. Its box has already been recycled into another, containing the newest model. Its parts are scattered and its arm had fallen off a week ago and was somewhere at the bottom of the bin. You find it, and shrug. Maybe you’ll play with something else today. After all, with your birthday a while ago and Christmas around the corner there’s bound to be more than enough toys for the rest of the day. You’re growing up after all, and maybe it’s time to get rid of your childhood toys and move on to bigger things. You drop it into the box and skip downstairs, looking for something to do. It smiles once more, sure you wouldn’t get rid of it just because of its worn out and missing parts.It’s a broken toy."

    "content": "“Is free will a myth?”It was a silly question at first, I suppose. A class in theory of knowledge that encouraged topics of deeper thought within a high school setting wouldn’t truly explain the concept of fate or autonomy. I asked the question with hope that it’d spark something, but the students around me seemed to look to each other as if it was a math question asked 3 years too late.“No.”But nobody said anything else. I prodded. I played devil’s advocate. I also was sure what I did was what I’d do. But I couldn’t see the nagging feeling in the back of my head. I pleaded for someone’s words to widen the crack so I could slip past the wall blocking me from what made me want to ask this question.“No.”I stood up. I didn’t think they understood. I paced and discussed every thought in my head and tried to beg for an answer to a question I couldn’t tell I had wanted to ask because I knew I wouldn’t like the answer. I expounded and looked around desperately at the other students with a manic expression.The bell rang, and the class packed up their bags.—I never got an answer. Not more than just “no.” It seemed like fate and free will were seen as tools of storytelling and fantasy to the rest of them, and my efforts to answer the question weren’t fruitful. At least, not how I wanted them to be. Because in truth, I knew they were right. I believed it too. Of course we had free reign over what we did—or at least we felt like we did. We needed to or it’d dismiss our achievements as predestined. It was so much easier to believe it was our action.And I couldn’t let it be. I needed there to be something else at play. A supernatural power dictating the world’s grand plan. I needed to know that my fate was set in stone, or I’d have to accept that it was my own choice.I’d have to look down at bloody hands, a knife dripping life as the bodies littered the memories of my life. The corpses of Joy and Ambition lying cold on the ground with red footprints following me down through time. A town of Normal that’d gone up in flames and the fall of Unconditional Love from its throne of Parenthood. I’d have to see their pleading faces as I cut them down and left them to decompose in the recesses of my mind.I’d have to believe I had killed them. That I could have stopped and chosen to drop the knife. That there was a chance that I could have kept them in my life till now. That fate is a simple myth to disturb the common belief that all effects come from causes that we can control. That free will is what we have to take control of our lives—the ability to choose and achieve and decide and regret. I’d have to believe that the reason I sit here with nothing but Loneliness to keep my company and Sadness to cheer me up is that all the others around me disappeared because of me.So that’s why you can’t say no. There has to be a chance that it was fated from the start."

    "content": "“It’s like staring down a tsunami in a raft”It’s what someone said to me one time. Not really just “someone,” but calling them a “life coach” gives less context and more questions. He was supposed to be helping deal with my neurodivergence, but he was just another camera in my life for my mother to keep close watch on why I wouldn’t look her in the eyes. I don’t know what she didn’t understand—instead, she said “depression isn’t that bad, I dealt with it so you can too.” She seems to think of me less as a climber in a hailstorm and more of a biker in a light drizzle. But maybe people responded differently to my apathetic nature in my fight with depression. Some saw it as confidence, and some saw it as ignorance. Some even saw it as optimism.It was resignation.Because when I saw that diagnosis, I didn’t respond apathetically. I cried. I sobbed and collapsed into my hands with defeat as the weight of everything dawned on me and I realized how fucked I truely was. Apathy set in because I realized I wasn’t beating it. I noticed what I was fighting and felt ready to concede to it. The power I felt I had was ripped away when I realized that even with the knowledge, no option would save me from what I was facing down.It’s been years now. At least 2. I don’t really remember. The meds stay by and are taken fairly regularly—I’ve seen what happens when I forget. My body feels numb and my mind feels slow and the rushing waves drown my voice till all I do is break down. Even with them, all they are is a paddle for my little raft. Therapy might have helped, but with my mother’s careful eye I can’t find the help I need without them getting chained to a room forced to report back to the overlord. For now, I’m “coasting” as my psychiatrist puts it. I’ll be just riding this out until things get better. Like they will one day, in the distant future.But inside, I’m trapped on this raft. A worn down set of planks held loosely together by frayed rope, barely buoyant among the high tides of an ocean while looking for a land that may never exist. All I can do is paddle slowly hoping to find that destination faster. Sometimes the waves will crash and I’ll have to hold on to a plastic mast that shakes and wobbles with each hill I crest. And with every storm, I’ll find the top of a wave crashing down upon me sending me tumbling into the depths. I’ll cling to the paddle and keep sight of the raft, but every time with the muffled sounds in my ears and surrounding pressure of water, I’ll consider simply giving myself to the unforgiving sea. To sink further and close my eyes as I find peace in the ocean and fall to the surface without a sound.And then as suddenly as I fell, I’d float to the top with a gasp and find myself scrambling back atop the raft. I don’t want to die—not yet. It’s too early. There’s too much to do. But everything I want to do has to wait until I get to dry land. And while lying my head against the soaked wood below me, I’ll fall asleep to dreams of waking up on sand with the sun beating down on me and all the people I loved surrounding me.And then, I’ll wake up. Stranded at sea. Alone."

    "content": "It just shattered as it hit the floor.The sound rippled through the air. I know everyone heard it. And before anyone could say anything, I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. My brother quickly stood up to see what had happened, but he didn’t say anything. I could hear someone start to speak, but I wasn’t listening. I just ran. I ran upstairs with tears falling down my eyes and hid in my room. I shut the door as fast as I could, but even that wasn’t as loud in my ears as the sound of that bottle breaking repeating in my mind.I know it’s just a bottle. There wasn’t anything inherently problematic about it. It wasn’t like I was carrying a platter of all of our meals for the night, or a fragile vase holding sentimental value to the rest of the family. It was just a bottle. We had dozens of them in the cupboard. There was really no reason to cry. Honestly, I didn’t really understand why I was crying either.Maybe it wasn’t the bottle. Maybe it was the night before where I had slammed haphazardly into the dining table, stabbed in the leg by the sharp wooden corner. But I didn’t cry then. I bit the inside of my cheek to stop myself from making a sound, and rubbed at my eyes to keep them dry. But I didn’t cry then, so why now?It could have been the moment three days ago when I had spilled a cup of water at lunch time, getting it on my brother’s pants before he had time to even begin eating. But even when he yelled at me, I didn’t break down or anything. I just kept apologizing, frantically reaching for napkins to help clean up my mess. The words “I’m sorry” continued to spill out of my mouth, but no tears fell. I hadn’t cried for a while, actually. But for some reason, dropping that bottle made me explode.It didn’t make sense. I could have cried any other time. I could have cried before when my sister came into my room and scolded me for not keeping it clean, It could have been a couple days ago when I tore a hole in my shirt and had to spend an hour sewing it shut, or that night when I burned the bread I was toasting for the night’s sandwiches. It could have been that week when I had fallen out of the sky on a trip out of the house, getting scratched up by the branches I fell through only for me to be scolded for leaving the house when I returned. It could have been the night the week before when I stumbled into my father’s room and had to remember that we’re one person short of our family.But I never cried. Not once at any time did I cry. But when that bottle broke…so did I. Everything just came rushing forwards and the tears wouldn’t stop flowing.There was a knock on the door. I didn’t stop crying. I only stifled my sniffles because all I could think of was that I was burdening the people in my house, and they probably only wanted to tell me to quiet down. They knocked again. I said nothing. I saw the doorknob turn as my sister opened the door. I didn’t make an attempt to look up at her—I didn’t want to see the look of disappointment on her face. I just sat there curled up, trying not to make a sound as my irregular breaths began to choke themselves back in an effort to make less of a noise.I felt her hand on my head as she kneeled down to me, but I didn’t make eye contact. I couldn’t explain what happened. I couldn’t tell her that I didn’t know why I was crying. I just felt worthless. I curled up tighter to take up less space. I just didn’t want to be any more of a burden then I had been.She wrapped her arms around me. She didn’t say anything to me. She just sat there for a while, holding me as I cried. I don’t remember how much time passed. But eventually, after enough time, I had run out of tears. I sat there for longer, though. I didn’t want to get up. I just sat there, letting my sister hug me and letting my breathing stabilize as the tears finally stopped.“Hey, what’s wrong?”She eventually said something to me, but I didn’t respond. I still didn’t know how to. It was like my voice was gone, and I didn’t have the energy to even look up at her. The silence that followed was deafening, but she still kept her arms around me.“Do you want to be alone?” She left another long silence. It’s just a yes or no, I said to myself. I didn’t have to talk. I didn’t have to say anything, I just needed to show her. I gathered all the energy I could to shift my head, tilting it up and down feebly. I tried to whisper out a “yes,” but all it came out as was a small whimper under my breath.She squeezed me tight once more before letting go, standing up to walk out of the room and slowly close the door behind her.Very shortly after, I was better. Not completely, but I had run out of tears. I just sat down on the floor in the silence of an empty room, wiping away at my face and trying to dry it with my sleeves. I didn’t have the energy to get up again. For some reason, there was no satisfying end to the sadness. There was an awkward period of time where my sniffles had faded, but the looming depressing of the past events had still kept me gloomy and upset.I just sat in my room for a while trying to unpack everything, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t wrap my head around how I had been so torn up about such small things, yet I couldn’t stop my tears from flowing. It felt impossibly painful even though nothing had hurt me. I couldn’t bring myself to do anything, and I spent over an hour lying on the floor with the threat of tears looming over.At some point, the lights had turned off in the hallway outside. I could hear small steps retreating into the rooms around me. At that point, I gathered myself and left my room. Part of me felt ashamed to see their faces. But, despite everything, I hadn’t eaten that night. Part of me wanted to lie in my own suffering and starve, but with the downstairs being vacant I decided it would be a good idea to find something to snack on.The light was still on downstairs, but nobody was there. I could see that the glass from the bottle had been cleaned up already. At the table was a single dish with my dinner, untouched and left alone. I sat myself down at the table, poking at my food idly as I looked around the empty room.The food was still warm. Or—I realized later—it had been reheated."

    "content": "When I look in the mirror…I think I’m seeing someone else.Not exactly, I suppose. It looks like me. I can see when my hair is messed up and I can clearly see the mirror image of the clothes I’m wearing. The mirror is doing its job, I’m sure. But when I look up towards my face, I don’t see me. I make eye contact with someone else. And she’s not happy to see me.Something in my eyes reminds me of a dagger. There’s a sharp glare she gives me that seems to attempt to cut through me. Even when I give the brightest smile I can, her eyes still pierce my soul. I’ve asked if that’s what I look like. My sister keeps telling me my eyes are soft and warm. But when I look into mine in a mirror, the stare she has gives me chills.It’s not in the pictures. There’s one on my wall that we took just a little bit ago. In it, we’re all smiling and cheerful. I have Nebula in my lap, one hand on her head and another around my sister. We’re all looking directly into the camera, and I can clearly see a joyous sparkle in my eyes and a warm smile. I look exactly how I’d expect me to. It’s not like that in the mirror.I keep looking towards myself in the mirror as if she’ll eventually change back into, well…me. That’s kinda how I see her, I suppose. She isn’t me. Or more accurately, she wasn’t the me that I was. It seemed like a me from another world or another time. And unlike me, she has a different attitude. She was angry with me. Disappointed. She stared at me with a disdain that I never saw from any other person. I don’t know what is wrong. Or, I do. I just don’t want to accept it.Deep down, I know exactly what is happening. I know that. I just don’t want to. It’s a mental block I have that I have no want to break. Maybe it’s just because I’m scared. Maybe because I’m worried what might happen if I do. Maybe it’s because I know what I did. I just refused to accept it for a long, long time.I know I’m the reason that our father isn’t here anymore.That stormy night in an unfamiliar world, he pushed me away.I don’t remember what he said. But I think he told me to run.And I did. I ran away.I was scared, I didn’t know what was happening.He was…trying to do something.And I abandoned him.…I didn’t see him ever again.Those eyes, staring deep into my soul. The shadow of her hair hides her true intent. I know what she’s thinking.“How could you be so cowardly?”"

    "content": "It never rained at home.I guess it wasn’t “programmed” to, for lack of a better word. Our home, our land—our very dimension was sculpted before I was born. Father created this world for us, and in his eyes rain just made it near impossible to fly. Thus, it was deemed useless. As a result, I never even knew it existed. Not until I got to leave, of course.I saw pictures whenever my father or siblings came back with news of their adventures. I’d see dark skies that left the land desolate and bleak. The dark blue pallet was always dreary compared to the bright green pastures I had grown to love. The water falling down from the clouds would soak the landscape below, leaving nothing but sticky mud and floppy leaves. It looked depressing, like the very world itself was crying. When I was a child looking at such a different world from the outside, I resigned myself to staying away from this harsh weather. It wasn’t till after I began going out on my own that my opinion began to change.I stepped out of the door into a mountain-esque clearing, elevated from the sea and closer to the sky. Like every other time, I opened my eyes to a new world unlike any I’d seen before. Unlike the other times, I was immediately greeted with a downpour of water. At first I thought someone had just dumped a bucket over me as soon as I had entered. My brother always pulled pranks like that—he’d fill a bucket up with water before balancing it on the top of an ajar door that I’d open later. Unfortunately, this time the water soaked me and then kept beating down on me even after the initial shock. Looking up and expecting to find a bucket or shower head, I saw the same melancholy sky that was in all those photos.Confused and sluggish, I found my way under a large rock which created a shade of cover. Trying and failing to brush myself off, my fears and reservations about going to a world with rain all came true. My clothes were wet and cold, clinging to my body in an uncomfortable fashion. My hair felt heavy and it’s glow was dampened, appearing more thick and clumpy rather than free flowing. Attempting to step outside of the safe haven, I found myself immediately stepping into a puddle of muddy water which soaked into my jeans, painting them a disgusting brown. I had a feeling I could fly farther away to find a place to hide, but I was worried about attempting to take off during such heavy rain. Spotting a patch of trees that looks dense enough to hold out the water, I charged out with determination only to find myself slipping on the dirt that had begun its transition to mud. Stumbling in the rain and falling down a couple of times, my sleeves became soiled as I had to stand up time and time again. Finally, I ducked under the trees and caught my breath.Shivering and cold, I tried my best to wipe the dirt and grime from my clothes only for it to spread and make everything feel gross and muddy. Sitting down on the dry root of a thick oak tree, I buried my head in my hands and felt a surge of anger at the situation. I took in a set of deep breaths while I tried to think of any way out of my situation. Leaving required flying away—an impossible task in the current downpour. The only option I had was to wait out the storm and pray it went away quickly.The wave of despair was almost enough to drown out the pleasant sounds of the rain hitting the treetops above me. The pitter patter of droplets pounding on the leaves became a rhythmic chaos that quelled the pounding of my heart, and the cold air around me began to change from a nuisance to a comfort. Peeking out around me, I noticed that the reflections from the water made a beautiful spectacle of light, transforming what would normally be an ordinary scenery into something brand new to me. I took a hesitant step off of the branch I was sat upon to reach a hand into the rain. I watched the mud and grime slowly wash away, and I took another step out and let the storm wash off the dirt.At some point, I realized that the cold had dulled my sense of feeling enough that the simple feeling of being “cold” was nullified. A strange warmth inside was keeping me comfy, and the rain falling down began to feel like a blessing rather than a curse. With a smile creeping on my face, I took a powerful step forward and ran around in the rain.With my wet hair flying behind me and my clothes soaked, I watched the rain beating down on the rest of the mountains, a beautiful and dull landscape that stretched out farther than the pictures my family had brought back. Seeing it in person, it all felt so…calming. The melancholy atmosphere was almost like a comfort, something that could resonate with me and warm me up in a way no sunny landscape could have ever done before. I was realizing that despite all my hesitations, I could really get used to it raining.Suddenly, a strike of light crashed down on a tree in the distance. Soon after, I was startled by the roar of thunder that came after.Maybe it’d take me a bit more time to get used to that."

    "content": "Trigger Warning! // This story contains mention of death and suicide. Please be safe before reading.Have you heard the tale of the bird that can rise from their ashes?The Phoenix, it’s called. It’s a mythical creature that exists in legends. Supposedly, it can never die. Its wings burn bright with fire as it flies from the ashes of its predecessor. A symbol of immortality. At least, that’s what I’m told. That’s what I am. Well…kind of. It’s what father always said. We aren’t birds of course, but…well, it’s because of our traits. Our wings. And our immortality.Me and my family can’t die. At least, it’s not easy to. If something was to be fatal to us, then it instead is just a hindrance. A bother I suppose. I’ve…never seen my family die. But I know we can. If we couldn’t…I’m getting off track. The point is, what I am is a Phoenix. And…there’s not much else to say about it.Well, there is one thing to say.I guess I wasn’t being completely honest with you. I said I had never seen any of my family die. Which is true, I suppose. I have a habit of telling these half truths that don’t tell the full story. The truth is…I’ve seen myself die.This is a really hard story, but I’m going to tell it anyway. One night, at some point in my life, I had a dream. It was like I was outside of my body, looking outwards at myself. I didn’t have a body in this dream, I was just a pair of eyes watching my own body as she moved without any input from me. There wasn’t anything else in the room. It looked like our kitchen, but everything was out of focus and blurry. It was l;ike I was seeing the remnants of memory where everything gave me a unique sense of deja vu.And I found that worst of all, I had no agency. I couldn’t move. Even as I watched my body pull out a kitchen knife from the countertop stand. I watched her turn the blade inwards, pointed at an unprotected section of her neck. And as she turned, facing me with a knife held in its dangerous position, I could see she was smiling. She thrusted the blade, and I didn’t close my eyes in time.She collapsed in a sea of red and life faded from her eyes.I woke up with a start soon afterwards, but the visions of it haunted me from then on. Every night was a dice roll on whether or not I’d fall into a dreamless sleep or be exposed to a new, dark and twisted nightmare. Countless times I’d watch myself die, leaving me guessing which dangerous object I’d turn inward and twist or push until my last breath was pushed out of my lungs and the beating of my heart stopped. Each time I’d feel the sharp pain of death, stinging until the sensation faded into nothingness.And each time, I’d watch as a glowing green light brighter than my wings swim out of the remains, creating a fountain. The bright rays create a big, shining heart that beats with a soft and comforting rhythm. And soon, just as suddenly as the feeling of death overtakes me, the soft and sensitive touch of life comes back.This cycle goes on and on. Each time, the feeling becomes clearer. As if my brain doesn’t want me to forget the sting of death and the breath of life, the feeling changes and shifts so as not to stagnate. Each death—each excruciating pain that burns or stabs or chokes—each different vision feels different and new but the aftershock of numbness always comes back around. It’s gotten to the point where—if I’m going to be completely honest—I don’t know if these are dreams anymore. I don’t know if I’ve really died or not. At this point, it starts to feel real.I’m starting to think that this immortality isn’t a gift. It feels like some sort of curse—a nightmare I can’t wake up from. Those visions haunt me. They haunt my dreams and I fear sleep. I keep thinking about who thought it was right to give us the ability to live forever.And I wonder if whatever fucked up god made me knew what they were doing."

    "content": "How far can I go?I’ve been thinking about this for a while. And I don’t mean distance, nothing like that. I’ve flown far, far away from home and come back just fine. The distance from home isn’t what I’m worried about. But instead, I’m worried about how far I can take it.Every once and a while, I leave home. I’ll escape through the door and I’ll fly out to some magical or mystical world. Something that expands beyond my wildest dreams, where my fantasy can become reality. But never for long. I would always worry about…What exactly? There wasn’t really any pressure. Sure, the people at home would miss me. But…I’m not them. I shouldn’t feel bound to them. I love my family, but…I don’t want to keep living in the same home with the same people and the same boring life. I want to be my own person. Away from the family, away from home…I want to start a new life. My life.And I’m not saying that my family isn’t a part of it. I highly considered bringing them along. I’m sure that without our father, we would be much better off living somewhere fresh and exciting. But…I want to do this myself. There’s something so appealing about life on my own. Nobody to depend on but myself. And I don’t think I could see myself being anything but a lone wolf.I say this like I’m thinking about leaving, but in truth I’m already gone. At least, by the time you’ll see this I’m gone.Tonight, I snuck out of my room as I do every other time I planned to leave. It’s just that this time, I took a small messenger bag with a couple of pairs of clothes to change into, some toiletries in case I ever find somewhere to use them, and some other utilities like a flashlight. I thought about getting a keepsake or two. After all, I didn’t know when I’d be coming back. But all of that felt attached to my old life. Something like that simply didn’t have space where I was going. I slipped through the halls and down the stairs, avoiding the creaky steps and slipping into the kitchen to prepare some sandwiches and grab some snacks in case I didn’t get a plan for food soon. As I finished cutting a loaf of bread into even slices, I realized I had been holding a serrated kitchen knife embroidered with the name “Celeste” on it with a bright green that popped on the black handle. I had instinctively reached for a set of kitchen knives that my father had given me as a present. He gave us all presents after our cooking phase. For my brother, a set of pots and pans with a set of various spatulas and stirring implements. For my sister, a group of measuring spoons and bowls, useful for when she’d try baking. And for me, who only would really find space to help out, a set of cutting boards and knives to assist them both with their ingredients. I slid the knife back into its place among the many handles, but it never left my mind.Packing the sandwiches into small bags and stuffing them into my bag alongside napkins and metal utensils that I wasn’t sure how I’d wash yet, I looked back at the knife rack. I slowly and carefully slid out one of the smaller carving knives. The blade felt weighty, and I began to feel uneasy at how comfortably I could wield it. Under my palm, I could feel the embroidered letters that spelled my name. I didn’t need a keepsake, but…A knife could be useful. For cutting vines if I was in a forest, or to assist me in crafts if I had to make something. It could also be used for defense. I swallowed hard as I tried to shake the thought. But, I knew I had to face reality. There was a chance I’d have to defend myself. It’s just in case, I told myself as I slid the knife into my bag. But this was a reminder to myself that I wasn’t just escaping to a fantastical journey of my dreams. There’s an inherent set of problems that could arise, and I needed to be prepared. I almost turned back right then.But I pressed forwards. The call of this new life was too strong to ignore, and I resolved to attempt to solve any issue with words before I would try using the knife. In my head, I checked off everything I did. I prepared my bag and grabbed what I needed, I left a goodbye note on the bed to tell them I wouldn’t be home for a while, and I made sure this was what I really wanted. I let out a long breath as I realized that this was, truely, the end of my preparations. All I had left was one more goodbye. I slowly opened the door to the night sky of the world I called home, walking out under the starry blanket towards the lone tree which stood unopposed.Coming up to the tall trunk, I ran my hand across the rough bark. There was a comfort in this place. A shelter during sunny times. A mark of home when I was flying. And most of all, a memory of times past marked by the red scarf that lay hanging from the lowest branch. Father told me he’d let me wear it when I grew up. That it was the family heirloom and would be passed down to me. But, after he died…It didn’t feel right. The night after, I came out here and hung it around the tree because I didn’t feel like I deserved it. I decided that he wouldn’t have wanted me to have the scarf anyways.Now that I think about it…that’s when I met you, isn’t it?Out of all the people I’d leave behind, I couldn’t choose to leave you out of the story. I’m sure you’d like to see where this will take me, so I’ll make sure to keep you up to date. After all, I still want to learn more about you. You remember why I wanted to learn about you, right? I don’t expect that I should stop trying to chase that goal even if I’m leaving.One day, I’ll visit you. I promise.With my final reminiscing done, I walked back home and slid in quietly so I could listen to see if anyone was awake. None of the lights were off, and the entire house said nothing as I closed the door behind me and crawled down the basement steps. I looked back at the home I was leaving one last time before I turned towards the same basement door I had been opening for all those years.It didn’t take all too long to figure out where I’d travel to, actually. My father—and to an extent my brother—have documented specific worlds with a simple system to determine simple things such as danger, habitability, and advancement. I picked out somewhere so that I won’t be bored, but also won’t find myself shot out of the sky again. I didn’t really read up on it too much. I wanted it to be a surprise, I suppose. In hindsight, that might have been a mistake.I’m telling you this as I’m standing in the doorway. My bag is slung around me and I’m only a step away from leaving this world behind. I’m feeling a lot of things. I’m excited. I’m anxious. I’m not sure what will happen.But this is the beginning of a new story. And this time, I get to write it myself."

    "content": "What’s the point of saying things like that?I understand wanting to help someone, but don’t you ever think that the things you say to people don’t make sense? There’s a comfort in words designed to be reassuring, but some of them don’t make sense to me.Like, “It hurts to see you like this.” Why does that matter? Does it not hurt them more to know that they’re hurting the people around them? I don’t think anyone ever wants to be sad. To let them know that their mood affects their others surely wouldn’t make them feel better, would it.? If I was upset, I’d rather you were to put on your bravest face and show only joy or comfort.I don’t know, I think that there are better things to say. Rather than saying “it hurts to see you like this,” perhaps there’s something better. If your natural reaction to saying that is to follow it with “so let me help you,” then why not just ask to help them from the beginning? I don’t think that you need to justify a reason to help someone.There are many other old proverbs that I don’t understand the use of. Like when you say “Every rose has it’s thorn” or “Everything has a cost.” If you mean to say that no good thing can come without a drawback or selfish reason, then you’d be saying something misleading. It’s true that life is filled with give and takes, but there’s no reason to force yourself to become hyper focused on what hidden meaning there is behind everything.ake for instance, a friendship. If someone purchased you gifts, is there really a secret reason they have for doing so? Well of course they do. They want to make someone they appreciate happy. It doesn’t mean they need you to reciprocate, perhaps they just enjoy seeing you smile. Maybe they want to spread joy to the people they think deserve it. There’s a deeper reason for it, but it doesn’t always have to be nefarious.And why do you see the need to say “all good things have to come to an end?” What’s the point? Sure, it’s hard to accept when a great thing is over. A day of celebration or the time of youth all are good things that have a set end, but what does the saying really do? In truth, doesn’t everything have to come to an end? It would be like saying that every green apple rots. It’s a true statement, but there’s no reason to say it when it’s a common fact that all apple will eventually spoil.Everything has a set point where it will crumble to dust. Every food has an expiration date. Every story has an ending. Each person has a set point in the future in which every last memory of them is finally forgotten, and the footprints they left in the world have all been covered by a layer of dirt thick enough that it was as if they were never there. So, yes, every good thing must come to an end. But why does that matter? Wouldn’t it be nicer to tell them that every bad thing will have to come to an end too?……Hey, why are you crying?"

    "content": "Food is an important thing for us.I’ve seen others get food delivered to them or made by other professionals out there, and I’ve heard of packets of food which come pre-mixed and ready to prepare in only a couple of minutes. In my family, however, we always made our own food. It was born out of necessity. When it was just me and my siblings in the house, we had to make whatever we could out of the food in the house. It started with just boiling pasta and cooking it with spices and sauces from the cupboards. When we ate it, we definitely had trouble keeping it down. We used sugar instead of salt, we let the pasta boil for much too long, and we didn’t do anything to balance the flavors. However, I couldn’t stop myself from still eating it. Something about making my own food made it taste better. If anything, the mixed bag of flavor left something memorable and unique about the experience.We got better, obviously. When my father came home to the mess in the kitchen he knew he had to actually teach us how to cook properly. He let me know where things were in the house and what I could make quickly when alone. Meanwhile, he had my sister cutting up vegetables and my brother learning about different spices. Something about us all in the kitchen made the house feel more alive, even Nebbie was running around trying to help us out. I was a little confused with everything going on, but I just focused on putting the things I was given where they were supposed to go.We finished a simple vegetable stir fry and all sat down together to eat. Of course, it wasn’t perfect. The bell peppers were charred because they were incorrectly cooked first, and the carrots were all cut unevenly because it was the first thing my sister tried to cut. Even so, we all kept going on and on about how delicious it was. Like I said, there’s something beautiful about imperfection that makes something memorable and exciting. We each cleaned off our plates, satisfied with full stomachs.Nothing I’d ever make would be that amazing. Sure, we learned to cut vegetables faster and evenly. Sure, we learned how long to cook things without setting them on fire. Sure, we learned how much of each spice to add to make each of the dishes we knew. But nothing would match that feeling of sitting together with my family, eating a dish we all made together. Even as my brother began to perfect the art of cooking, getting better and better at an alarming rate. He began cooking each meal for the family, eventually becoming even better than my father. My sister never abandoned that skill, but my brother refused to stop improving and become content with his cooking prowess. He cooked almost every meal for the family from breakfast till dinner, filling the house with new smells every day as he perfected his craft. But still, nothing would compare to that first meal we made together.Once father was gone, the kitchen lights didn’t go on for a while. My brother refused to cook for us anymore, and even when there was food he took it to his room because he didn’t want to sit at a table with an empty chair. Some nights, my sister didn’t come to eat either. It was just me, alone at the table with a mash of vegetables and some various herbs and spices there to make it palatable. The silence of the table made each bite feel like a strained effort, like the oppressive quiet was forcing food into my mouth that I didn’t want to eat. Eventually, I didn’t come to the table. I stopped eating, at least until I got too hungry and ate some plain pasta slathered in jarred sauce to stop my stomach from rumbling.Things eventually went back to normal. Well, not exactly. Nothing was ever the same after we lost our father. My brother grew distant, and only cooked some of the time. Mostly, it was me and my sister making the food. At some point, someone took father’s chair from the table and hid it away somewhere. It made it easier to sit at a full table, but there was still something missing. Conversations grew stale with only us, and there were often pauses where we all ate silently before someone brought up a topic.I quickly learned that it wasn’t the dish that made that first meal so memorable. It was the company. Everyone comes together to make something, each of our unique voices making it into the end result.And with someone gone, we could never make another dish like that."

    "content": "I didn’t even know we had a basement.I mean, I knew we had one. It was just a place I didn’t get to go. One of the number one rules in the house was not to go into the basement. Father would disappear down there from time to time, but it was off limits for me. It wasn’t like I wanted to go down there anyways. Looking down those stairs I saw a growing darkness that shrouded the door, threatening to push out and around into the kitchen and living room if it wasn’t for the piercing lights on the first floor. When father disappeared into the darkness, I could only imagine he was fighting off a great evil that kept our house safe.That illusion was broken once I had grown up more, and fears of ghosts and ghouls lurking in the shadows began to become just a twinkle in my memories. By then I had a good grasp on flying, and one day my father took me downstairs for the first time in my life. Each step down the stairs made a unique creak that made me pause. There were so many theories and speculations that were about to be put to rest, and despite it all my father trotted down like it was a well worn path. After what felt like an hour, I stepped off the last creaky step and my father opened the door to the dark, dusty basement.But that’s not the door that matters.In the basement, buried in dusty trinkets from the past and old bookshelves holding stories I’d never read, was a wooden door I’d never seen before. It didn’t look as dilapidated as the other furniture in the basement, but chipped paint and scratches made it look well worn. There was a dark, ominous light coming from under the door, and it was hard to take my eyes off of as my father led me into the basement. Lucky for my curiosity, he ignored the rest of the clutter and led me right up to that door.Without hesitation, he opened it up and strolled into an expansive room that stretched farther than my eyes could see. In fact, I realized that it was larger than could have even existed below our house. The roof stretched up till it was almost as high as a sky, and it felt as though the walls ran farther than the rolling hills outside. It was one of the first instances that day where I saw something I felt was worthy of the word “supernatural.”Spanning from the center was a massive computerized system, something I didn’t quite recognize at the time. Concepts like the “internet” and such were also supernatural in my eyes then. After all, I lived in a tiny cottage with the same family. In the moment, the case of the bigger-on-the-inside room and the magical cable tower were on the same level. The large futuristic system was covered in metallic plating and blinking lights that seemed impossibly random, and screens covered the surrounding walls with beautiful landscapes and scenes from places I never saw.My father could tell I was overwhelmed, and he took my hand and led me into the room. I remember him explaining everything in depth, something about all the different screens. But in my head, everything was still spinning. I lived a life watching shadows for so long that processing how much was out there was impossible at the rate I was seeing it. Shaking, I clutched my father’s hand tighter and followed.He led me to a wall and gestured to the surplus of screens. “Pick one,” he told me. I stood still for a moment, silent. I didn’t really process what he meant. Pick? Pick what? I wanted to speak up and ask for clarity, but my voice was lost as my anxiety and fear kept growing. After what felt like a minute of silence, I slowly walked towards a screen with a valley of beautiful pink trees, raining petals down on the grass under the peaceful sun. I looked back towards my father for any sort of confirmation, and he simply gestured for me to keep going. I moved closer, coming face to face with it before reaching out a timid hand to tap the screen.Suddenly, every screen around it went dark. The gentle light of the room faded as the lights from the screens disappeared and all that was left was the screen in front of me. I squealed, jumping back into my father who pointed me back towards the door we came into. Back the way we came was no longer a dimly lit and musty basement, but instead was open to a brightly lit valley with the same pink and green colors on screen. Finally, everything clicked. I had spent so long processing what he was showing me until I finally realized just what was happening.All of these were worlds. Places with different people, different landscapes, different cultures. And we were able to visit them.With a hesitant step, I walked through the door."

    "content": "I still remember the details of the first time I left the house on my own. Opening that door for the first time with bated breath and stepping out into an unknown light without anyone beside me. A strong sense of independence filled me up as I took a strong step out to a world outside of the small field I had lived in……and immediately tripped on the roots of a large tree.Brushing off the leaves and dirt from my hands and jeans, I stood up and opened my eyes to an ever-expanding forest. Overgrown leafy foliage stretched out across the floor and covered the ground in a green hue. All around, large tree trunks erupted from the ground and exploded into the sky, creating a green canopy from which rays of light shot down to illuminate the outstretching land. Other than the rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze, the only other thing I could hear was the soft chirping of far away birds. Each step I took let out a soft crunch as leaves and vines gave way to me when I began to move out into the forest.Seeing a forest wasn’t anything special, I suppose. I had been out of the house before—father took me out sometimes when I got bored, and he always showed me pictures of the places he visited. That being said, standing all alone in a new place filled me with a feeling I couldn’t really describe. A mile long smile spread across my face as I skipped through the forest without a care in the world.Then, I heard a crunch of leaves that didn’t come from me. My body froze in place. And that warm feeling of joy quickly skittered away to make room for a creeping fear that shackled me to the ground. I turned my head as quietly as possible, looking towards where I heard the noise and coming face to face with nothing. The silence that followed was accompanied only by the chirping of birds beneath the beating of my heart. After what felt like hours, another crunch resonated from behind the tree.A young kid with ruffled brown hair peeked out from behind the tree trunk, peering at me with deep brown eyes. He hesitated as we locked eyes, slowly taking a crunching step out from behind the tree. He turned to me, holding his hands behind his back with a timid expression as he studied me. His brown jacket was worn down as if handed down from generations passed, and I could see clear rips in his jeans. Yet more years passed while we stood face to face, neither of us able to open our mouths. That was until a young voice rang out from behind the boy.“Hey, why’d you run so far away?” A little girl a bit taller than the boy skipped over from behind, her matching brown hair braided in a much neater fashion than the other’s. The girl stopped as she stood next to the other, looking at him before turning to me. “Huh? Who’re you?”Something about her forwardness took me aback. The moment for me felt monumental—I was meeting someone else other than my family for the first time in my life. I felt as though the time that stood still was a wonderful painting that would stick with me forever as a still frame, but instead this girl had approached me as if she was my neighbor. Despite it, however, her suddenly addressing me snapped me out of my trance as I stammered.“Oh! Um…I’m Celeste.” My voice came out quieter than it did in my head, and I refused to make eye contact as I recited my name like it was the first day of school. “Uhh…who’re you?”“I’m Lucy!” The girl stood tall with a proud voice, then gesturing to the boy next to her. “This is my brother, Danny!” Danny, respectively, gave one shy wave as he stayed silent during the pause her sister gave him. Not that this silence lasted long, as Lucy soon walked up to inspect me. “Why are you here? Why is your hair green?” She began firing off questions as she circled around me. “Where did you come from? You don’t look like any animals I’ve seen.”“H-hey!” I stopped her train of thought abruptly “Look, I’m not from here, but that’s no way to treat a stranger.” At least, I think? I mean, when I thought about it, I realized I wasn’t exactly sure how people interacted with each other. Something about the casual little girl made me forget that this was my first time talking to someone outside of my family. Immediately, I shifted back to a defensive posture.Lucy pushed towards me, bringing her face to mine with an intense stare. “What’s with your eyes too? They’re so bright and glowy.” I flinched, taking a step back and retreating from the girl’s stare. As soon as I did, however, I heard them gasp in wonder as I realized what had happened.Opening my eyes, I looked behind to find my wings unfurling as I had released them out of instinct. Danny’s jaw dropped as Lucy watched with wonder. My face flustered, I turned away and started running, taking off swiftly into the sky as I heard Lucy call from behind me. Slowly, her voice faded out into the flowing wind as the forest behind me.I soon made my way home. Father taught me how the doors worked and how to get home if I ever found myself outside the nest without a door. I scurried back into the house before anyone noticed me, retreating to my room to decompress. My heart was still racing, and part of me was sad I left so soon.So, the next day, I went back."

    "content": "(This story is a directly related to A Dream - Part 3)[Start Transcript]Hi. Surprised to see me?It’s our first time meeting here. Face to face, that is. We’ve been talking, even if you don’t always realize that we are. It’s a strange relationship, I suppose.I don’t really know what to say. I just thought it would be a good time to talk with you person to person. It’s been a while now. Just over a year ago if you want to put a timestamp on it, but you could trace me back to ever since you were born. You might not know everything about me, but I’ve been here watching your life play out.I’m sorry, I just…I’m really nervous. I mean…I already don’t get out much. Now I’m meeting you for the first time, someone who I haven’t gotten to talk to directly but have been in contact with for years. I was getting butterflies in my stomach just thinking about when this would happen and it turns out…it was tonight.I apologize for the rain, too. I don’t know why it’s so heavy, but…I suppose it’ll keep coming down hard. I know you don’t really like rain, but I have fond memories of it. I’ve only ever really seen it a couple times whenever I’ve gone out.I don’t know when we’ll get a moment like this again, but…hey, wait why are you crying?…Don’t worry, I’ll get a new jacket. This one’s yours, after all.I understand how you feel. I guess it’s strange to find ourselves separated after everything. I suppose it’s a little bittersweet.I know what it’s like. I used to follow my father everywhere he went. I wanted to eat with him, talk with him, play with him. Everyday I just wanted to be with him more and more. I never realized it when I was young, how that dependence kept me grounded when all my life I should have been flying. It was a time I never thought to look inside myself because I was always looking out.After he…well…when he left, I didn’t have anything anymore. I spent so many years poured into one thing that when it was gone, I didn’t know how to start again. And…well, if I could give you advice, it would be to just…keep moving forward. I know it sounds hollow, but if you take things day by day you’ll start to figure out where to go. Whenever a door closes, a new one will open somewhere. You’ll just have to find it.…As time goes on, I’m sure we’ll both figure out what we’re meant to be. But that’s not what I’m worried about. Right now, I want to bring you somewhere. Trust me, you’ll like it.[End Transcript]"

    "content": "I guess I haven’t talked about my wings, right?I don’t know if you’ve seen them yet, I suppose. I don’t usually flaunt them when I’m wandering the house, and most of the time when I’m outside I hide them because they can cause trouble. It’s not really easy to fit in with two large green wings sticking out at all times.And before you ask: Yes, yes I can fly with them.I only really mastered it recently, though. Just like you have to learn to walk and crawl, little baby me had to figure out how to use these big wings of hers. Luckily, the rest of my family has them too. My father helped me get off the ground, and my siblings taught me from there. It isn’t as hard as it sounds, the only reason it took so long is because I needed to grow old enough to actually control myself. Our wings don’t grow with the rest of the body, they’re at full size when we’re born.Yeah…father showed me pictures. Just imagine me, shorter than your lower leg, with wings spanning out almost as far as a grown adult’s arm span. Cute, maybe, but I stumbled quite a bit. Anytime I let them out it’d end with a broken vase and a trail of feathers leading to my room.I always wondered why my wings left feathers. When you’re looking at them, they glow as if a bright light was shining through glass. The light’s edge fades to a blue as the edges of the wings seem almost transparent. They look almost like a moving sculpture, one solid crystal spreading out behind me and moving like flowing water. There’s an outline of feathers, as if imitating a bird’s wing, but they were hidden under the emanating light. Despite this, I find that I leave a trail of green feathers that fall off my wings when I fly. Each holds a faint glow of light that shines from my wings, dim as if fading away.There were more complications when I was young. Growing up, I even found them taking different shapes. As a kid I remember once looking in the mirror and seeing a pair or massive fairy wings as opposed to the bird-like wings that usually stretched out from behind me. As it turns out, our wings aren’t a set shape. My father had to explain that our wings change shapes in an effort to find a pair that best suit the owner. In that way, they’re almost like a sentient partner that’s permanently strapped to our backs. Because my family only knew how to fly with one pair of wings, those were the ones I was trained with. However, that didn’t stop me from pulling out other wings when I was playing around in my room.The more I think about it, the more the properties of my wings seem unnatural. No matter their shape, they have the pattern of a butterfly’s. And, despite their smooth and almost crystalline look, they’re incredibly soft and warm. I remember whenever I hugged my father, he’d spread his wings and wrap me in them. My sister did the same, always sheltering me when we’d sit underneath the tree to rest. In addition, while they’re rather heavy they’re also incredibly fragile. I recall accidentally leaning on one when I stumbled onto a wall, and feeling as if it crumpled like a piece of paper. It also got hurt in…other ways.One time that I went out I got into some trouble. I went through the door in the basement as I always do when I’m looking to get some fresh air and feel some sense of freedom. The world opened up to tall buildings and slick machinery, a technologically advanced society with mathematical beauty. The night sky was black in contrast with the colorful skyscrapers and busy streets, who’s glow outcast the dull nature that surrounded the town. I tried to walk around and learn about the town, but it wasn’t that simple. People somehow recognized I didn’t belong—people began to stare and I got stopped by a group of officers. With no words to defend myself and the increasing concern of those around me, I tried to fly away. I quickly spread my wings, running off and away from their shouting as I lifted off into the air. Opening up into the open sky, I retreated from the city that pierced the night. Just as I thought I had escaped into the night, a piercing pain shot through my spine and I could feel my right wing scream out in agony. Suddenly, I began dropping back down to the ground. I tried harder and harder to rise, but each movement shot a stinging pain through my body as it felt like a needle was stabbing through my wing. In a confusing mess of feathers and leaves, I fell down through treetops to a cliffside in the outskirts of town.When I woke up again, I was lying in a bed of grass surrounded by feathers and leaves. With a pained groan, I lifted myself up and tried to hold my head to somehow soothe my splitting headache. I looked down at myself, trying to wipe off some of the dirt and other debris that I collected while falling. Wiping off some of the blood from my cuts, I remembered the pain that shot me out of the sky. I took a few deep breaths, then looked over to my right wing to see what had happened.There was a hole in my wing.My eyes widened as I pulled my wing in closer to see. I sucked a quick breath of air through my teeth as I tapped it lightly with a finger, trying to stroke some of the searing pain away. The hole was large enough for a golf ball to fit through it. The edges were shining an aggressive and blinding green as if burning away, light leaking out of the wound. The rest of the light from the wing was dull and darker, as if threatening to flicker out like an old light bulb. There was no blood flowing out or anything. There was just a missing part of my body.I slowly got up as the pain started to shift from an intense burn to an overwhelming soreness, limping to the edge of the cliffside to look out at the blinding lights radiating from the city below. At that moment, I was convinced that my power of flight had been taken away from me. I was certain that my wings would never work again. It was the first time that I felt such a strong sense of fear.There weren’t many dangers in our little world. I was safe with my family, and there was no serious pain or stress I had to deal with. It was always fun and games—low stakes and with plenty of failsafes. But this time, I lost something dear to me outside the safety of my home. I looked once more at the hole in my wing, feeling my heart sink as I could feel air blow through it.For what felt like hours, I stood on the cliffside watching the city lights clash with the night sky. Anger, sadness, regret, fear—all these emotions swirled inside me like a storm, but all I could do was stare in silence at the city that robbed me of flight.Later, after going home, my sister and brother helped take care of it. They were too worried to scold me for going out and being so reckless—I came back with a mess of hair and cuts all over, refusing to look them in the eyes. When their anger faded into worry and they asked what happened, I unfurled my wings and let them see the injury. Sister helped clean up the bruises and other injuries I had while my brother carefully wrapped a dark cloth around it to keep the wound covered. They told me it would heal with time, and brought me to a bed before I passed out from pain and exhaustion.Sometime later, the hole was gone, replaced with the same flowing butterfly texture as if there was never a break in it. For a couple of days I refused to try flying again. I was scared of that feeling of falling like I experienced when I was first shot down. It was like drowning, constantly reaching for life while falling faster and faster away from it. Despite coming home, that fear I felt didn’t leave me. Not for a while, at least.Eventually, I climbed to the roof of our house and spread my wings. With my sister ready to catch me, I let myself tip off the edge and closed my eyes. I felt the air get caught under my wings, and when I opened my eyes I was gliding down to the tree, and I heard my sister cheering through the air that I was flying thorough. My wings worked fine, albeit my flying skill was worse after how long I went without any practice.Despite knowing my wounds could heal without much issue, I never lost that fear. Flying wasn’t just a tool for me, it was an escape. It was a free feeling of the wind in my hair, excitement as long as there was no roof. I had to learn the hard way that I couldn’t take it for granted.But I kept flying anyway. I was just a little more careful when I left the house. After all, there’s no point in protecting it by keeping to the ground. If I was going to keep my wings hidden all my life, then what was the point of having them?"

    "content": "I found a stray cat.I shouldn’t have. Or, more so, I shouldn’t have been able to. Where I live, nothing is supposed to find us. Yet despite that rule, that one fact of my world that was supposed to be true, I found a cat. It was small—not small enough to be a kitten or a newborn—but it definitely wasn’t a large or scary cat. It’s dark grey fur was well kept, and it didn’t look dirty. There was no collar, and no sign of where it had come from. It was laying down in the grass a ways away from our tree. It lay dormant, basking in the sunlight while snuggled up in the grass.I hesitated for a moment. Only for a moment. Soon, curiosity got the better of me and I began approaching the cat.  Not quickly—I started slowly stepping towards it, trying not to scare it away. Slowly closing the distance, I could feel a soft fear wash over me. It was just a small twinge at first, a tingling in my spine that made me hyper alert of the sounds I was hearing. I noticed how loud the blowing wind and the rustling of leaves were behind me. Every small crunch of grass felt louder than the last. The fear began to grow, and the pauses between my steps began to grow longer. Strange concerns began popping into my head. The fear of not fitting in. The fear of being out of place. It was then that I realized the fear wasn’t mine, but the stray cat’s.I have an odd relationship with emotions. That’s how my father always described it, at least. He always told me that there was something wrong with the way I acted, and it wasn’t until I was much older that he finally understood how to explain it. According to him, emotions would “infect” me, like a sickness. If someone around me was happy, I would start to laugh. If someone near me got hurt, I’d cry more than they did. He told me that if someone nearby was feeling something, I’d contract the symptoms.I guess I never realized that it was abnormal. After all, I’ve experienced it since I was born. It wasn’t something I was necessarily conscious of—at least, not all the time. It was like breathing—I wasn’t always aware of it, but if I focused on it I could feel it and try to control it. When people were really happy or really angry around me, I could feel the same feelings as naturally as I breathed.As I got closer to the cat in front of me, its crippling fear grew around me. Despite it, I continued to step closer and closer. By the time I was next to it, the pressure of emotions almost had pushed me down to my knees. I slowly dropped myself to the ground, lifting a cautious and shaky hand towards the cat. With surgical precision, I slowly placed my hand on the back of the cat and softly ran my fingers through the fur.Suddenly, the cat jumped up. I gasped, all the tension and dread that had built up causing me to fall back onto the grass. My heartbeat echoed through my ears, my eyes closed tight. After what felt like ages, my breath slowed and the sound of blood pumping had left my ears. What followed was a long, long silence. Even the wind stopped blowing. I kept my eyes closed, a new fear gripping me as I tensed for whatever was to come. Finally, I heard one soft, cautious meow.I slowly opened my eyes to find two bright blue feline eyes staring back at me. I blinked. The cat blinked back. I slowly sat back up, turning my head to follow the gray cat crawling over into my lap. Sitting down with another meow, it once again stared at me with its big blue eyes. As the fear inside me melted away, I slowly placed my hand on its head and softly stroked its gray fur.There was a small silence before the cat let out a soft purr, nuzzling my hand. Wrapping an arm carefully around it, the cat leaned against me with a gentle grace as it closed its eyes. The fear was gone, and what replaced it was a warm calm that wrapped around us. For that moment, it felt like the rays of the sun shielded us from the rest of the world as the wind sang notes of joy. Just then, every anxiety and stressful feeling melted away as the cat soothed me as much as I soothed it.Too soon, I heard my sister calling my name. As quickly as it had come into my life, the cat hopped off my lap and disappeared in a bright blue flash. In one moment it was there, but in the next it was gone. It took me a second to even register what had happened. But all too quickly, my sister called for me once more and I was brought back into the house for lunch.As of now, I’ve never seen the cat around again. I don’t know where it went, or if it plans to come back. Everytime I think about it there’s a pit that forms in my stomach, a worry that I’ll never see the cat again. Despite how boring life was, and how little seemed to happen every day, it was the first time that something happened so quickly that I couldn’t do anything. There was no chance for me to even speak, to learn its name or what its goal was.Sometimes, all we’re left with are memories."

    "content": "The first thing I heard was a heavy fall of rain.I could recognize that it was a dream immediately because of how foggy everything was. I’m sure it’s obvious because I’m looking back after the morning of, but even at the time I recall finding an odd calm in such a strange scenario. The details are still mysterious, but I can vividly remember the feeling of the rain falling down on me. Unlike most of my dreams, I actually had a physical body. My hair was soaked, and without my jacket my arms were exposed to the harsh weather. The wind made my arms feel cold enough to be numb, but I couldn’t be bothered to cover them up. I let myself get drenched in the heavy rain as I looked around where I was.I was standing on the street of a neighborhood, although I didn’t recognize the place. It was hard enough to see with the rain, but there was also a thick fog that extended past and hid the horizons. It was just far enough to make out the shapes of various houses that gave me a sense of deja vu, but were never particularly recognizable.I hesitated to take a step in any direction. Part of me was worried about slipping on the wet ground, but most of me was simply scared. In the short moment I had stood there, I heard nothing but the fall of rain against the concrete below me and the rustling of my wet clothes in the wind. There was no sunlight piercing through the gray clouds above. I stood frozen in the rain until I heard the cadence of soft footsteps behind me, and turned around to be face to face with her.Through the fog, Celeste emerged in her dark grey hoodie and jeans. Despite having cover, she refused to put up her hood and let her hair get soaked in the fall of rain. Her bright and wet hair clung to her, and under the assault of the rain it had lost its glowing aura. Even with her green hair and piercing eyes, under the rain there was nothing left of her magical aura. The girl in front of me just looked normal. Like anyone else.“Hi.” Her voice rang out, piercing the beating of the heavy rain. “Surprised to see me?”I hesitated before saying anything. For some reason, my mouth felt shut as I was face to face with Celeste. With my own persona. She continued talking, but I could barely focus on her words. I stood paralized under the rain, afraid to take a step forward and not willing to take a step backward. There was something so surreal about seeing myself standing before me.As she stepped closer, I noticed how she was a couple inches shorter than me. It made sense, after all I recall that I was always a little taller than her in my dreams. But as she stepped closer and those few inches became more and more noticeable, I couldn’t let it slide. It reminded me of something critical.Me and Celeste were not the same person.All my life, I felt so lost and afraid. Each day I kept trying to pretend like I knew what I was doing when I assumed everyone else already knew. Once high school started, everyone was joining clubs and reaching towards achievements when I still didn’t know where I wanted to go. When I discovered Celeste—this other side of me—I finally felt like there was a purpose to life. A place I had. For once, I felt like I could be my own person.But even then, I knew that I wasn’t solving that fear. Whenever I looked in a mirror I didn’t have flowing green hair or bright and beautiful wings. I was putting on her persona as a mask when in reality I had nothing. Without her, I didn’t even have a name. I wasn’t anyone.Suddenly, I was returned to my rainy dream as I felt a hand rub away a tear that had begun to fall. Looking back at Celeste, she gave me an uncertain smile. She hesitated before saying anything else. For a brief moment, I looked her in the eyes and pleaded for her to help me. All I could do was silently cry for anyone to help me figure out what to do. If I wasn’t her, then who was I?As she took her hand away, she pulled off her jacket and wrapped it around me, covering up my arms which had grown numb from the cold. Despite how wet the jacket felt, as she wrapped it around me a warmth spread quickly through my body. The rain still beat down on us, but I hardly felt it anymore. Celeste stepped back, ineffectively brushing off her arms as they proceeded to get soaked under the heavy downpour. She let out a small giggle as she felt the full force of the rain before looking back to me with her smile.“Don’t worry, I’ll get a new jacket. This one’s yours, after all.” She began to talk again, but I felt the haze of the fog covering the rest of my dream. The next thing I remembered was waking up in my bed, groggily getting up as the sun peered through my windows.Despite how often my dreams repeat, I never had that dream again."

    "content": "Mili - Children of the CityIn Mili’s song “Children of the City,” the speaker uses orders known as Prescripts as a symbol to convey that blind following stifles one’s free will and purpose. Immediately, the speaker begins to relay orders that they have heard, such as “sleep for a total of 800 hours per day,” and “only eat, or write, or pull the trigger with your right hand.” These are called Prescripts, orders given to citizens living under The Index, a government style branch that offers protection to the people under it. The Index promises to keep the citizens safe as long as they complete their Prescripts, and the examples given by the speaker help illustrate how confusing and seemingly pointless they can be. The speaker then explains that “by the time you realize, you’ll be restrained to a desk,” explaining that once under the Index’s protection, “you’ll comply, eyes chained to the test.” The Prescripts are a symbol for these restrictions, as their pointless orders consume the lives of those underneath them. Abandoning dreams and wishes, the citizens solely follow the orders given to them by the Index. The speaker, realizing this, is forced to come to terms with, “the fact that other than to expand we had no purpose,” and states that they now, “must be comfortable being who I considered worthless.” Without the freedom that is taken away by the Prescripts, they see their life as pointless. Living only to follow orders given by their higher ups, the speaker discovers that despite the safety they have they’ve become a single cog perpetuating what seems to be a meaningless goal. All in all, the song “Children of the City” by Mili uses Prescripts as a symbol to illustrate that free will and purpose are erased by the act of blind following.DECO*27 - UndercoverDECO*27’s song “Undercover” uses prisoners as symbols to express that emotional influences make it impossible for one to fairly judge others. The speaker describes the plight of ten prisoners who are all being tried for a murder they committed. Their fate will be decided by the prison warden, who must choose if they are innocent or guilty. However, the speaker then notes that, “you get to know them and then tie them with their EGO,” asking the question, “can you really judge them?” While each prisoner represents a murder, each come with their own stories and personalities. The prisoners symbolize the human element that blurs the verdict they should be given. Challenging the warden, the speaker believes that they begin to relate the prisoners and their cases with their personality. This is expanded on when referring to the, “border between ‘Hate’ vs ‘OK’,” which the warden is then asked, “is it really ok to be…deciding with just your EGO?” EGO, which the speaker continues to refer to, is the conscious part of the brain which is considered one’s self. Because of the emotional connection the warden begins to make with the prisoners, their ego begins to get in the way of objective decision making. The clouding that these emotions cause blurs the border between what is unforgivable and what is acceptable. This dilemma escalates once the warden is told that after “a false accusation full of mistakes,” the prisoner “would probably smile and be pleased.” The speaker informs them that falsely acquitting a guilty prisoner would result in bloodshed, showing shadows of the warden themself being killed by them. The stakes are too high for one’s ego to be getting in the way. Overall, the song “Undercover” by DECO*27 uses prisoners to symbolize that one’s rational judgement is blinded by their emotional influence.Mili - Gone AngelsIn Mili’s song, “Gone Angels,” the speaker uses tone and volta to convey that revenge can’t right a wrong. The speaker begins first by directly addressing someone, telling them that “the pages remind them you’ll always be a villain,” referring to books and pages that they’ve gotten from their addressee’s killing spree. The song starts by painting this addressee in a negative light, bringing up memories and history that weighs heavily on the speaker. Due to the heavy tone brought about, the listener can infer that the speaker holds resentment towards the addressee. This idea is further emphasized later in the song, as the speaker displays an intent to kill the addressee as they were “brewing all this hatred so [they] have a reason…to see [the addressee] dead.” The dark tone that is emphasized by heavy piano and a minor key signature paint the sadness and anger felt by the speaker, conveying the feelings of resentment the speaker wishes to resolve. However, the speaker’s tone changes later as they say that they’re “gone from the stage that allowed [them their]…only dreams,” and makes the statement that “pain always catches up to those who chooses to stay.” This volta illustrates the process of the speaker changing their view, coming to terms with their own agony instead of deflecting it onto the addressee. This idea of pain catching up refers to their own feelings of guilt and agony, finding that revenge won’t quell these emotions. Overall, the use of tone and volta in Mili’s song, “Gone Angels” displays the idea that revenge won’t resolve one’s sadness."

    "content": "August 12th, 2019An Unfinished PuzzleA poem about not fitting in quite right.A spectrum of light reaching through clouds,Effulgent light breaking through the sky.The piece looked like it was from a dreamBut it didn’t fit, so I was forced to say goodbye.An immaculate feather of a beautiful blue jay,The sign of a soaring prodigy destined to fly.The piece looked like it was sent from the heavensBut it didn’t fit, so I was forced to say goodbye.A lone petal of a blooming rose,The crimson landing pad for a colorful butterfly.The piece looked like it was sculpted by professionalsBut it didn’t fit, so I was forced to say goodbye.While I took the path less travelled,I found myself lost in a dark forest without direction.Though lost in a sea of dispiriting sorrow,I begin looking for a matching piece; looking for some form of affection.The beauty I witness invites me to a world that doesn’t fit.But I can’t continue with a piece that doesn’t click.If I bend my tabs and blanks for a life that doesn’t match,I’d end up as a pile of crushed paperboard, like a clock that doesn’t tick.Am I destined to find the piece that I fit with?Or must I compromise to connect somewhere, forced to watch my edges crumble.I take my stride across the unlit path, compiling courage and leaving my footprint trail.Until that fateful day, I’ll remain a body without a heart; an unfinished puzzle.October 29th, 2020Snakes in the ShowerA poem about negative voices.Turning on the showerWarm water spilling out onto the floorA lengthy sigh escapes into the scalding steam.In rhythmic tapping of drops on my backMy eyes softly close as steam encircles me,And I sink to the floor underneath the water stream.Sitting in the showerWith water rolling down my skinMy wet hair drops down like snakes on my head.First one, then two, then the whole familyMy shaky exhale stumbles out into the airAs my cold, dormant heart fills up with dread.Sighing in the showerAs my snake family begins to speakAll the words that I find I’m afraid of.First one, then two, the the whole familyEach spitting out scalding insults I try to escape fromAs tears stream out like the warm water above.Crying in the showerThe snakes screaming louderMy thoughts starting to whirl and my mind beginning to swirl“You’ll never be as good as him”“Your choices will never get you anywhere”“The people you trust will betray one once more”“They wanted a boy, not a girl”Turning off the showerSnakes spitting out their last drops of waterI take my towel and rub the tears from my eyes.As I stand before the mirrorAnd comb my wet hairI say goodbye to my snake family of lies.December 25th, 2020Nobody CaresA poem about a particularly irksome phrase I hear often.Nobody caresBecause you’re someone newAnd what you’re passionate aboutIs something we haven’t been throughNobody caresBecause we have no connectionAnd can’t stand to listenSo we raise this objectionNobody caresIs a common reactionFrom people I talk withWhen I reveal a passionWell I don’t careThat you can’t stand me to be excitedI don’t think that it’s fairThat my happiness is unrequitedNobody caresIs the stupid excuse you deployJust because you can’t bearTo listen to what brings me joyNobody caresBecause I’ll just go elsewhereAnd talk to all the peopleThat I know still careMay 27th, 2021Ice Cream on a Cold NightA poem about things that are bittersweetThere’s an odd beautyIn ice cream on a cold nightFeeling the cold breeze on your neckAs you bask quietly in the moon’s light.And as you close your eyesFinding a pleasant warmth in each biteYou let down all your wallsAs you dig into your frozen delight.As you take a brief respiteSitting on the swings in an empty parkThere’s a strange charmIn watching shadows play tricks in the dark.The feelings of loneliness don’t attack youEven across from the empty bench,Looking over to watch the empty swing setAnd see faces from the past fill the gaps.There’s an odd beautyIn reflecting on an old memoryLiving in a time that has passedLike a recurring dream.And seeing that face next to youBrings a pain to your heartBut the feeling is numbedBy the cold of your ice cream.Even as the memoriesReach and cling to you heartThe cold of the night and your frozen treatKeep the tears from your eyes.And in your brief respiteSitting on the swings of a park from times pastYou let the past run freeAnd play in the shadows until the sunrise.There’s an odd beautyIn ice cream on a cold nightThat reminds you that one dayEverything will be alright."

    "content": "Recently, I stumbled upon an old sheet of paper from years prior. It was a math assignment, but I couldn’t tell what year it was from. It looked like it was ripped from one of those workbooks we were given at the beginning of the year, well before we started getting textbooks that we’d solve problems from on lined paper. The lesson was on probability, but the thing that caught my eye was a handwritten chart, the pencil marks fading away on the thin paper. All it had was the 36 values that 2 6-sided dice could roll.Dice had become a big part of my life since then. I started playing tabletop games and I was introduced to Dungeons and Dragons. I ended up buying myself not one, but two sets of dice to carry around as my own. I began playing war simulators, and bought tens of dice to use as counters. Almost daily, I’d roll dice to determine an outcome. To determine if my shots hit the target or if my disguise fooled the guard. How well my sword cut the vines, or how well I understood the lovecraftian scriptures.Back then I didn’t understand that the important thing about a dice roll wasn’t what number it rolled. In reality, it was important to decide when to roll my dice. It’s all about maximizing your chances. Rolling dice with bonuses that guarantee your victory, or deciding to flee instead of fighting impossible odds. But most importantly, it’s all about the reward.The most important thing to remember is what you’re trying to achieve, and what is at stake. If you roll to see how well you can sneak past highly trained guards just to retrieve a ring you found on the corpse of a goblin from a session ago, there’s a chance you risk your life for something with little value. If you try to cheat at a card game in a bar just to impress your friends when the people you’re against are carrying knives, there’s nothing to truly gain. I didn’t understand this for a while.One day, our school was the target of a threat posted on social media. According to information I received after, there were a couple pictures that made it seem like someone was threatening to bring a gun to school. Because of this, the school said that it was ok for people to skip school due to feeling unsafe. I, however, was planning to go to school. The night before the threat was supposed to be carried out, I didn’t feel worried. In my mind, there was such a little chance that a school shooting would actually occur. There wasn’t anything to worry about.I got calls from my brother that my mother was incredibly distraught that I had chosen to go to school. When she came home, she begged me to stay home in case anything happened. I agreed awkwardly, and both my brother and mother took me into a large embrace. It was only then that I began crying, when I realized what I would have done. I didn’t realize how much I was risking just to attend a school day that was optional. Even if there was such a small chance, there was no reason for me to roll the dice.That day I stayed home, lying in bed and letting the day tick by and texting friends back and forth. Nothing happened. In fact, it was later discovered that the guns in the pictures were fake, and had been purchased as props for a music video. That night the anxiety should have faded away, knowing that no shooting truly occured. But fear gripped me tighter. All I could think about was what would have happened if I rolled my dice and turned up snake eyes.Recently I’ve seen an increase in my skill in tabletop games. Everytime I play, I find that I’ve gotten much better since I started playing. No matter if I’m fighting zombies, trying to survive in a snowstorm, exploring the mystery of a ghost town, or trying to smuggle counterfeit goods into town, I’m finding myself managing to win more and more. But it isn’t because I got lucky all of a sudden.It’s because I know when to roll my dice."

    "content": "Hi! Um…I’m Celeste!I don’t know much about you, honestly. All I know is that you know about me, although I’m not very certain how much you know about me either.But we can change that! I want you to trust me—after all, if we’ll be working so closely together you should be able to put your faith in me, right? So, let me tell you a bit about myself!I live with my brother and sister in a tiny house in a small pocket of the world. Nobody can really find us where we are, at least that’s what I’m told. According to my father, he made it so that nobody would come after us. I don’t really understand why anyone would want to hurt us, but my father was always really paranoid.My sister usually takes care of us. She’s the oldest out of the three of us, but my brother still likes to take change when he can. She’s usually the one who accompanies me when I go out anywhere or sanctions my brother’s travels. My brother’s a kind of…lone wolf, I suppose. He’s really kind, I know that, but he doesn’t usually spend much time at home. He’s the only one of us that goes out often, so he’s usually not home.I spend a lot of my time at home bored. It’s really hard to find stuff to do, you know? It’s really quiet in the house sometimes, and there’s not much to do outside when my brother is out and my sister is cooking. I’m usually just left laying in the grass, where me and Neb usually relax.Oh! Nebby is my pet dog! She’s been with us ever since I was born—at least, I can’t remember a time where she wasn’t there. My father told me that I used to never get sleep unless I was resting against her. I don’t blame young me either, Her fur is one of the softest things I’ve ever felt. There’s still nights I cuddle with her so I can sleep after a long day.I know father was trying to protect us when he moved here, but I still don’t really get it. I don’t think people really want to hurt us. I mean, I don’t think people are really evil. Sometimes they just don’t understand that what they’re doing is wrong. I’m sure a lot of people do things and regret it afterwards.Either way, I wasn’t going to be kept inside for long. One night that I couldn’t sleep, I followed my brother downstairs to the basement where I found a door hidden behind a sum of boxes. Moving them out of the way, he started to slip through the door. I didn’t follow him immediately—I was really worried he’d notice me, so I snuck back upstairs and hid under my blankets until the sun came back up. After breakfast, I went back downstairs to investigate.I never wanted to spend time in the basement. It was always dark and dusty, and every step on the old crooked floorboards would let out a loud, sharp crack that rang through the room. Sneaking over and pushing the boxes to the right, I saw a well kept door that stood out in comparison to the dimly lit, run down underside of the house. A dim light was leaking out of the crack under the door. With a deep breath, I opened the door and left my home for the first time.After I discovered there was more than the little cottage and tree I grew up in, I began to sneak out as often as I could. Weekly, daily, any moment that I could I’d slip past the door in the basement and explore whatever world was on the other side. Every world I went to was different, with different scenery and different people. Sometimes I’d be only a couple minutes. Other times I’d stay for hours, or days. Sometimes weeks or months. Time passed differently in those worlds than it did in mine. I’d leave for ten minutes even if it felt like a year, or I’d leave for what felt like a couple days and weeks could go by. My brother would always yell and my sister would always worry, but nothing stopped me from venturing out to the other worlds.I met lots of interesting people and saw many interesting sights, but the strangest thing to me was the world I couldn’t visit. I heard my brother talk about it sometimes. He’d been visiting every world like crossing them off a list and he found one that just…didn’t work. Circled in red on his wall of notes, there was just one place he could never go to.I tried myself. I didn’t understand how the door worked, or how to choose where to go, but after enough worlds I found one I just…couldn’t. The door led to a black void—like a computer that hadn’t been turned on. I could feel there was something there, as if I was bumping around a room without the lights on. I desperately tried finding my way, trying to turn on the lights or find the power switch to whatever this world was.That’s when I found you.I’m not sure how to make you trust me, but I want you to know I’m not here to hurt you. If anything, I’m here to help you. Hopefully I can explain it all to you in due time.For now, how about you tell me a bit about yourself?"

    "content": "It was years and years that these dreams kept coming back. The same tree. The same house. The same grassy field. The same girl.I refer to “dreams” as the set of them. They repeated, sure, but they always built off of each other. Each time they came back they’d be ever so slightly different. Like the creation of a game, the world kept getting altered and changed every time I revisited it. Every so often the event in question gets wiped and a new one takes its place.It was some point during these dreams that I saw her family. At least, what I think is her family. There were a few other people that I saw with her that were in the same house. Every once and awhile I’d see another girl and a boy join Celeste around the house and in the plains. I watched the three live a life enclosed in a small world. Whether they know of larger worlds—worlds like the one we live in—I do not know. I don’t even know how they get their food, from all I can see it just lasts in an endless supply.The other girl, I presume her sister, appeared quite a bit. She had a rather slim build, but was taller than Celeste. Her eyes were a bright cyan that matched her short and wavy hair. Her bangs were smooth and her hair fell right to her shoulders and flowed behind her with an elegance compared to the childish innocence of Celeste. I often saw her caring over the house as the oldest would, making tea and coffee in the mornings before everyone got down. The three of them would have rather compelling conversations, all filled with energy and smiling. They all acted as family, bearing unbreakable bonds that only strengthen every day.There was also a boy who looked younger than the girl, but acted older than Celeste. His black hair was short and messy, in a chaotic but somewhat natural way. It felt as though he had styled it, each individual hair set to lay perfectly where he had wanted it. The tips of the hair were painted bright yellow, once more matching the eyes given to its host. I didn’t see him as often—he spent a lot of time alone in the house or outside in the plains away from the girls. He came back to cook dinner with the others at night, but they didn’t interact in the middle of the day. Despite that, they had a good relationship. I saw them laughing and playing often, and there didn’t seem to be any discourse. The three lived happily in their home, free of burden.I couldn’t shake the thought that there was someone else. A fourth—someone missing from their table who they used to live with. I never saw any proper evidence I suppose. The table had many extra seats, so it’s not like there was one sole empty seat or anything. It just felt…off, I suppose. There was just an uneasy quiet—a never ending echo that rang through the house waiting to be quelled by the voice of someone missing. I was guessing—no, I was certain—that it had to do with that scarf.The scarf in question being the one that Celeste hung up on the tree near their house. In every dream I had the scarf had stayed tied around the tree, blowing in the calm breeze that accompanied the sunny days and bright nights. I saw them all look up at the scarf longingly—as if it represented a memory long lost to the ages. There’s something there—untouched by the residence of the house but always lurking in the background. There was a very prominent aura it gave off, and the long lost memory left by the scarf seems to wrap around the endless landscape of the plains.I couldn’t shake the thought that this was more than my “dreams.” Normally I heard people talk about dreams that I never had. Dreams of fame, wealth, or glory. Dreams where they were the star of the show. In my dreams, I wasn’t anywhere to be found. At least, that’s what I had thought.The dreams continued for a long time. I slowly began to write notes down, figuring out what the purpose of them was. I have a notebook—a simple, red bullet journal that I got online. It was something I began to fill ever so slowly as I continued to have such strange visions. I only got a few pages in though. It’s not that I lost interest or anything. In fact, what happened next just made me even more curious.Pages started to fill in themselves. Believe me if you will—I certainly had trouble believing it myself. I’d wake up some mornings with a foggy head and look over to my book already opened to a new page. It started with just single words—something added that I certainly didn’t remember. Over the course of months it began to become more noticeable. More words appeared, and they started to tell a story. Slowly they’re creating sentences—taking up more and more of the empty space in my notebook as they become more frequent. I’ve barely made sense of them. Everytime I read them my head starts to spin and I can barely focus. However, I think there’s something more important about them than their context.Often, I write for the sake of conveying emotion. What that means is I don’t write to make a point or tell someone something specific, but instead I just try to get out a feeling that I have. I’d talk about something with a free flowing style and just list out whatever came to my mind. When I started to see patterns in the words, it reminded me of the nonsensical writings that I wrote whenever I wanted to get something out. My head starts to fill in blanks left by the words—a story, or parts of it at least.Recently, I stored my journal next to my computer. I’m going to try and transfer the feeling left by these words into some kind of writing. I don’t know what I can really do—It’s a complete longshot that this can even tell me anything about whoever is writing these words and if it’s even connected to my dreams. All I can do is try it.Feel free to read the stories that come from this. Perhaps you can help me understand more about this character, despite me being the one to create it."

    "content": "I first saw it in a dream.I’d refer to it as an out of body experience. It felt almost too real to be a dream. I was groggy—my head felt like it was about to split open. As time went on, I began to recover and my vision started to adjust. The blinding sun was pressing down on me like a heavy weight, keeping me disoriented and making me feel trapped. As time went on, the sun began to retreat and the spinning feeling in my head began to recede. I can’t say I really opened my eyes—throughout the whole thing I never felt like I really had a say. Finally able to process the surroundings, I looked at the world I was put in.The first thing that stood out to me was a single large tree, up a small hill rather close to me. It’s leaves were shining with a heavenly glow, almost golden with the light of the sun piercing through them from behind. It’s trunk stood sturdy and thick upon its small hill, serving as a notable landmark among the large plateau of grass that stretched out around me. The rolling grassy fields that extended far out had no end in sight, reaching past what one would see as the horizon to go outwards endlessly. The only other thing that stood out was a small wooden cottage that lay dormant, a ways away from the hill the tree was on.As if on cue, the door to the cottage opened, a small light spilling out from the inside. Small voices could be heard from the door, and I could see someone hesitating before they left the house. I tried to move closer, but I still was without the feeling of an actual body. My consciousness just floated there on the side, waiting as the voices finally stopped. Someone stepped out of the house, wrapping a bright red scarf around their neck as they closed the door behind them. They stepped slowly yet elegantly towards the large tree, planting each step firmly after the next.I could tell she was a rather young girl. The first thing I noted was her bright green hair, long and glowing. It fell well past her shoulders and to her arms, where the vibrant green faded into a dull silver and stopped before her hands. The hair’s radiant color made her stand out among the empty landscape, flowing behind her as a light yet sinister breeze began to pick up. With determined steps, she continued to walk forwards towards the tree.She wore a loose long sleeved shirt patterned with white and black stripes, which extended past her hands in a feeble effort to cover them. I could see her hands balled up into fists, still walking strong as the wind began to grow stronger. Her steps became slower as she lifted an arm to cover her eyes, trying to move forward as the breeze changed into a powerful gale. I could hear the leaves of the tree rustling as the wind became stronger and stronger.The girl slipped, falling to her hands and knees as she lost her footing on the hill. I could see her trying to stand up again, but the gale threatened to push her back down to the bottom of the hill. She stayed there for a brief moment, regaining her composure while the wind continued its assault. With vigor, she stood back up, brushing the dirt off her jeans and continuing to step forwards.Finally, as she crested the hill and made it to the base of the tree, the wind stopped. Her hair fell back delicately onto her shoulders as she looked up at the large tree. Slowly taking off the red scarf she had on, she held onto it tightly for a brief moment before looking up towards the sky. Slowly and gracefully, a pair of bright green wings stretched out from behind her. Glowing and almost translucent, the wings stretched out farther than her arms and almost threatened the glow that came from the light in the tree. Despite being adorned with what seemed like feathers, they looked like one cohesive shape—almost as if crafted from a pure form of bright light.As gracefully as they were released, the wings flapped delicately and slowly to lift her off the ground, helping raise her up and level to the closest branch, which leaned down almost as if awaiting her. She steadily took the scarf and wrapped it carefully around the branch, letting it drape down and flap in the calm and gentle breeze that had since replaced the windy storm. As slowly as she had ascended, she elegantly floated down to the base of the tree.Looking up longingly at the scarf, I found it hard to judge how she felt. Whatever that scarf was—whatever it meant to her—was left a mystery to me. After what felt like an eternity, she closed her eyes and showed a small smile. Then, as if she knew the whole time, turned towards me and looked at my nonexistent form. The sun started shining brighter and brighter as her eyes were glowing a beautiful green. The last thing I saw were her piercing green eyes, soft and warm as I felt the rays of the sun beat down on me.–Soon after, I woke up in my bed, golden rays of sun peeking out of my window. I couldn’t recall anything else that had happened, and my entire body felt sore. I slowly got out of my bed and dragged myself to the kitchen, making a cup of coffee in a feeble attempt to wake myself up. Slowly, I got energy and went through my day normally. I always assumed that would be the end of it, but the dream still always stuck with me. I suppose that story is what started it all. That dream was the thing that created “Celeste” in my mind. However, something always bothered me. There was a nagging feeling I never could shake away.Did I “make” Celeste like I thought, or did she always exist?"

    "content": "I have an unabating disdain for failure.To spend so much unnecessary time—so many precious hours or even days of my fleeting life just to trip over the finish line. A failure to produce results after countless efforts. An incredible sum of courage and spirit consumed by an inescapable, inevitable void of pain. Every single failure is one more setback that I have only myself to blame for.I’ve realized just how important time is. Any scrap of time that I can salvage is a resource that I can apply to the fleeting life I hold dear, allowing me more action—more freedom of my life that I can feel and take hold of. And to spend so much time—so much important, important time—working towards that freedom for it to be removed is soul crushing.Everytime I fail I have the unquenchable urge to try again. Everytime I push once more past the failure and try to salvage the precious time I had spent. I gather up the shards of my mistake and push them together in an effort to hold something in my shaking, beaten hands. I beat my head against the wall, punching and kicking in a futile attempt to break it down and push through.Every time, I fail.I fall down to my knees, confronted with the fact that my time was wasted. I clench my tired hands and scream into a void of pain, piled high with the failures I can’t mend—the embodiment of the time wasted, never to return. The pile of mistakes extends to the heavens, and as I reach ever closer to the void I fail to fathom how deep it goes.The sands of time I had piled up to collect fall through my feeble hands and disappear unknowingly into the abyss I stand above. Another pile of trash to add to my past—an endless void full of failures and mistakes. Nothing to salvage, nothing to save, nothing to achieve. An endless nothingness. An insurmountable and overwhelming empty void.Yet despite it all, in face of constant never ending failure,I reach out towards the light that shines bright against the abyss.Deterred, unmotivated, crushed, uninspired,I stand once more and trek through the hellish landscape in my mind.With a neverending spark within my soul, I extend myself towards a fleeting dream impossibly far away, yet close enough to feel within my broken fingers. I stretch out my arm as a feeble yet noble attempt to close the gap that spans past the void around me. I reach out because I know that the light beyond the walls exists. Unlike the void that surrounds my mind, I reach out to a dream that’s within my grasp.The eternal nonexistent fight within my mind wages constantly.Yet I shall stand one more."
