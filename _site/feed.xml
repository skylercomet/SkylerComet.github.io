      With Patch 8 coming tomorrow to “Baldur’s Gate 3,” I want to highlight how phenomenal of a game it is. This amazing game is, however, not a TTRPG and not for lack of trying.

Larian Studios and their Game of the Year entry “Baldur’s Gate 3” is a stunning RPG that uses the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons world and rules to create a massive and dynamic story. It was the kind of game that took a bit of con...

      With the general pessimism surrounding “Marathon” as Bungie’s new IP, I think it’s important to remind people why we should keep open minds and try out games. That’s why I played Hole.

With us one day after the Marathon announcement from Bungie about their new PvPvE extraction shooter, we’re officially going into the insufferable social media period in which it seems that the only opinion you ...

      With Bungie giving us more details on “Marathon” to think of with a September release date, I’m really excited to see an extraction shooter that’s starting to play more with the genre in ways that finally have me excited for the results.

Today was Bungie’s latest stream to finally drop off some gameplay footage of their new shooter—the PvPvE Extraction Shooter named “Marathon” that was announc...

      I wanted something chill for my birthday, so I decided to write something about birthdays that I’m both constantly reminded of and also reminded of too little.

I know that people have very different ways of expressing their birthdays—some friends enjoy every day with a countdown to their special day, and others often shrug it off and avoid it. I’m somewhere close to the latter—I often keep my ...

      Digital ownership sucks, especially as we move into a place in which time frames are getting longer between the release dates of video games. Even if it doesn’t affect me directly, I don’t love it.

Today’s topic once again comes from my research, a particular thing that gets me thinking about the bigger picture of something in gaming. I would hate to become a writer that posts daily “How to ge...
